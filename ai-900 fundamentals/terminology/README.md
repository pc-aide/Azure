|2|QnA Maker|Question and Answer (QnA) Maker is a cloud-based API service provided by Microsoft that enables you to create a conversational question-and-answer layer over your data. It is part of Microsoft's Azure Cognitive Services. By uploading structured or unstructured content, including documents, websites, and FAQs, QnA Maker automatically extracts questions and answers, making them accessible through a simple REST API. This service simplifies the process of adding natural language processing capabilities to applications, allowing for easy integration of rich, conversational AI features. It supports multiple languages and provides tools for refining and customizing the knowledge base to improve accuracy and relevance. QnA Maker is commonly used to build chatbots for websites, services, and applications, providing users with quick and relevant answers to their queries.|
|3|NLP|Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to comprehend, generate, and manipulate human language. Natural language processing has the ability to interrogate the data with natural language text or voice|<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WjZdqbD.png"><br/>eg NLP:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lFloxSy.png"><br/><br/><ins>Immersive reader tool</ins><br/>**Sentiment analysis**<br/>Scoring the text for sentiment, as having a positive or negative feeling<br/><br/>**Semantic modeling**<br/>Identifying the relationships between words<br/><br/>speech tagging (adjective, noun, or verb)<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vccT4rC.png">|

|7|Responsible AI|<details><summary>1/6 Fairness</summary>Fairness in responsible AI refers to the principle of ensuring that AI systems treat all individuals and groups equitably. This involves designing and implementing AI in a way that minimizes bias and discrimination, ensuring that the outcomes of AI applications are just and equitable across different demographics, including race, gender, age, and socio-economic status. The goal is to create AI technologies that contribute positively to society, promoting inclusion and diversity</details><details><summary>2/6 Reliability & safety</summary>Safety in AI involves designing AI systems that operate within safe parameters, posing no harm to humans or the environment. It focuses on preventing unintended consequences and ensuring that AI applications do not create risks or dangers, especially in critical areas such as healthcare, transportation, and public safety.</details><details><summary>3/6 Privacy & security</summary>Privacy in AI involves ensuring that personal and sensitive information processed by AI systems is handled in a way that respects individual privacy rights and complies with data protection laws. It focuses on maintaining the confidentiality and control over personal data, preventing unauthorized access, and allowing individuals to know how their data is used.<br/><br/>Security in AI refers to the measures and techniques implemented to protect AI systems from cyber threats, unauthorized access, and attacks. It encompasses the integrity of data, algorithms, and infrastructure, aiming to prevent manipulation, theft, or damage to the AI system and the data it processes.</details><details><summary>4/6 Inclusiveness</summary>Inclusiveness in AI refers to the principle of designing and implementing AI systems that consider and serve the diverse needs of all user groups. It aims to ensure that AI technologies are accessible to people with a wide range of abilities, backgrounds, and characteristics, including those from marginalized or underrepresented communities. Inclusiveness emphasizes the importance of diversity in AI development teams and decision-making processes, to avoid biases and create AI solutions that are equitable and beneficial for everyone.<br/><br/>Yes, inclusiveness in AI specifically encompasses people with disabilities, including individuals who are blind, have mobility impairments, or face other challenges. The aim is to ensure that AI technologies are designed and developed in a way that makes them accessible and usable for everyone, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities. This includes creating user interfaces that are adaptable for assistive technologies, developing algorithms that consider the diverse ways people interact with technology, and ensuring that AI systems do not inadvertently exclude or discriminate against people with disabilities.</details><details><summary>5/6 Transparency</summary>Transparency in AI refers to the openness and clarity about how AI systems operate, make decisions, and are developed. It involves making the methodologies, data sources, and algorithms used by AI systems understandable to users and stakeholders, without requiring specialized knowledge. The goal is to ensure that individuals and organizations can comprehend how AI decisions are made, the factors influencing those decisions, and the potential biases within the systems. Transparency supports accountability and trust in AI technologies by allowing for scrutiny, understanding, and informed decision-making regarding the use and impacts of AI.</details><details><summary>6/6 Accountability</summary>Accountability in AI refers to the principle that developers, operators, and users of AI systems should be responsible for the outcomes of these systems. It entails having mechanisms in place to attribute consequences to the parties involved, ensuring they can be held liable for any harm or wrongful actions caused by the AI. This principle encourages ethical development, deployment, and use of AI technologies, ensuring that there are clear processes for addressing any issues or damages that arise. Accountability in AI promotes trust and fairness by ensuring that those who benefit from AI technologies also bear responsibility for their impacts on society and individuals.</details>|<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hpN4ouC.png">|
|8|Tokenization|Tokenization breaks text into smaller parts for easier machine analysis, helping machines understand human language<br/><br/>ChatGPT, in its current setup, has a tokenization limit of around 4096 tokens. Tokens can be words, parts of words, or even punctuation, depending on the language and complexity of the text|<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Z3Ax8Ci.png">|
