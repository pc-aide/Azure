Upload a PFX file to Azure App Service|<details><summary>Answer</summary>b. Add a hostname to Azure App Service<br/>d. Upload a PFX file to Azure App Service<br/><br/>You need to register a domain and add it as hostname for the web app. To access the application on https protocol, you need to upload the certificate and add a binding.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-web-sites-custom-domain</details>|
|4|You have deployed an application in an Azure App Service.<br/>You need to analyze the error logs of the application.<br/>Which two methods should you use to view error logs ?<br/><br/>a. Check DetailedErrors inside LogFiules Zip<br/>b. Check Application insider LogFiles Zip<br/>c. Navigate to App Service, Diagnose & solve problems, then search for Failed Request Tracing Logs<br/>d. Navigate to App Service, then check for Activity Logs|<details><summary>Answer</summary>a. CheckDetailedErrors inside LogFiles Zip<br/>c. Navigate to App Service,Diagnose & solve problems,then search for Failed Request Tracing Logs<br/><br/>[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RzmjZB4.png">](https://i.imgur.com/RzmjZB4.png)<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/troubleshoot-diagnostic-logs</details>|
|5|You are developing a globally distributed application using Azure Cosmos DB. You must ensure that latency must be low for data write operations and require order guarantee between distributed databases.<br/>Which consistency level should you recommend for the database ?<br/><br/>a. Strong<br/>b. Bounded Staleness<br/>c. Session<br/>d. Consistent Prefix<br/>f. Eventual|<details><summary>Answer</summary>b. Bounded Staleness<br/><br/>Bounded staleness is frequently chosen by globally distributed applications that expect low write latencies but require total global order guarantee. The reads are guaranteed to honor the consistent-prefix guarantee. The reads might lag behind writes by at most "K" versions (that is, "updates") of an item or by "T" time interval, whichever is reached first.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/consistency-levels</details>|
|6|You have deployed an application using Azure Container Instance.<br/>Sometimes, application is taking more time for initial load.<br/>You have verified the logs and noticed that your container is taking a long time to start, but eventually succeeding<br/>Which of the below factors would have caused to take a long start time ?<br/><br/>a. Image size<br/>b. Image location<br/>c. Cached images|<details><summary>Answer</summary>a. Image size<br/>b. Image location<br/><br/>If your container takes a long time to start, but eventually succeeds, start by looking at the size of your container image. Because Azure Container Instances pulls your container image on demand, the startup time you see is directly related to its size.<br/>Another way to reduce the impact of the image pull on your container's startup time is to host the container image in Azure Container Registry in the same region where you intend to deploy container instances. This shortens the network path that the container image needs to travel, significantly shortening the download time.<br/>Azure Container Instances uses a caching mechanism to help speed container startup time<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-troubleshooting#issues-during-container-group-runtime</details>|
|7|You are developing an application to process orders. The Azure Web App pushes the order information into an Azure Queue Storage.<br/>You have an Azure Functions App code that process the orders as shown below.<br/><br/>`public static class OrderProcessor`<br/>`{`<br/>`[FunctionName("ProcessOders")]`<br/>`public static void ProcessOrders([QueueTrigger("incoming-orders")]CloudQueueMessage myQueueitem, [Table("Orders")]ICollector<Order> tableBinding,`<br/>`TraceWriter log)`<br/>`{`<br/>`log.Info($"Processing Order: {myQueueItem.Id}");`<br/>`log.Info($"Queue Insertion Time: {myQueueItem.InsertionTime}");`<br/>`log.Info($"Queue Expiration Time: {myQueueItem.ExpirationTime}");`<br/>`tableBindings.Add(JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Order>(myQueueItem.AsString));`<br/>`}`<br/>`[FunctionName("ProcessOrders-Poison")]`<br/>`public static void ProcessFailedOrders([QueueTrigger("incoming-orders-poison")]CloudQueueMessage myQueueItem, TraceWriter log)`<br/>`{`<br/>`logError($"Failed to process order: {myQueueItem.AsString}");`<br/>`...`<br/>`}`<br/>`}`<br/><br/>Select Yes if the below statement is true. Otherwise, select No<br/><br/> 1. The Functions App code will log the time that the order was processed from the queue<br/>2. The function will retry up to five times for a given order, including the first try if the ProcessOrders function fails.<br/>3. When there are multiple orders in the queue, a batch of orders will be retrieved from the queue and the ProcessOrders function will run multiple instances concurrently to process the orders.<br/>4. The output of the ProcessOrders function will move the order to an Orders table in Azure Table Storage<br/><br/>a. Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes<br/>b. No,Yes,Yes,Yes<br/>c. No,No,Yes,Yes<br/>d. yes,No,Yes,Yes<br/>e. Yes,No,No,Yes|<details><summary>Answer</summary>b. No,Yes,Yes,Yes<br/><br/>1.  InsertionTime is the time that the message was added to the queue. Not the order processed time<br/>2. By default, Queue triggers retry requests up to five times. After the fifth retry, both the Azure Queue storage and Azure Service Bus triggers write a message to a poison queue<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-error-pages<br/>3. When there are multiple queue messages waiting, the queue trigger retrieves a batch of messages and invokes function instances concurrently to process them. By default, the batch size is 16.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-storage-queue-trigger?tabs=csharp<br/>4. The output is saved to Orders table in Azure Table Storage</details>|

|10|You are developing an application to create and publish surveys.<br/><br/>The application will use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for authentication.<br/>The application will have a front-end web app and a back-end web API.<br/>The web API will handle the requests from the front-end web app. The web app must authenticate with web API by using OAuth2.0 bearer tokens. The web app must authenticate by using the identities of individual users<br/><br/>What should you consider to generate access tokens ?<br/><br/>a. AAD<br/>b. A Web App<br/>c. A Web API|<details><summary>Answer</summary>a. AAD<br/><br/>1. AAD is a comprehensive identity and access management solution provided by Microsoft. It allows you to manage user identities and access to resources in Azure and other Microsoft services.<br/>2. For your scenario, you'll need to configure your front-end web app to integrate with Azure AD for authentication. This integration will allow individual users to log in to your web app using their Azure AD identities.<br/>3. Once the user is authenticated, the front-end web app will request an access token from Azure AD to access the back-end web API. This access token will be a bearer token that authorizes the web app to make requests on behalf of the authenticated user.<br/>4. The back-end web API should be protected and configured to validate the incoming access tokens from the front-end web app to ensure the requests are legitimate</details>|
|11|You are developing an application to create and publish surveys.<br/>The application will use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for authentication.<br/>The application will have a front-end web app and a back-end web API.<br/>The web API will handle the requests from the front-end web app. The web app must authenticate with web API by using OAuth2.0 bearer tokens. The web app must authenticate by using the identities of individual users.<br/><br/>What should you consider to authorize decisions based on access token ?<br/><br/>a. AAD<br/>b. A Web App<br/>c. A Web API|<details><summary>Answer</summary>c. A Web API<br/><br/>You can authorize the access based on access token in Web API<br/>1. The front-end web app will obtain an access token from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) after a user logs in and grants the necessary permissions.<br/>2. This access token will be included in the HTTP requests made by the front-end web app to the back-end web API to access protected resources<br/>3. The back-end web API, being the service that handles requests from the web app, needs to validate and authorize the incoming requests based on the access token.<br/>4. When the back-end web API receives a request with an access token, it should validate the token's authenticity and perform the necessary checks to ensure that the user associated with the token has the appropriate permissions to perform the requested action.<br/>5. Azure AD provides a mechanism for validating access tokens, and your web API should leverage this capability to authorize decisions based on the received tokens<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-v2-dotnet-native-aspnet</details>|
|12|You are developing an application using Azure web app and Azure SQL Server.<br/>You need to implement dynamic data masking on a column that stores social security numbers as a string in the format "123-45-6789â.<br/>You want to mask everything except the last four digits.<br/><br/>Which data masking function and replacement string should you choose to fulfill this requirement ?<br/><br/>a. Dfault, "XXXX"<br/>b. Text,"XXXX-XX-"<br/>c. Credit card, "XXXX-XXXX-"<br/>d. Email,"XXXX-XX-"|<details><summary>Answer</summary>b. Text,"XXXX-XX"<br/><br/>Use Text, adds a custom padding string and number of characters to be exposed prefix and suffix.<br/>1. Dynamic Data Masking in Azure SQL Database allows you to define masking rules on specific columns to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. It can dynamically mask the data as per the defined rules, and the original data is not altered in the database.<br/>The "Text" data masking function is used to mask a portion of the data while keeping some characters visible. In this case, "XXXX-XX-" will mask the first five digits of the social security number and show only the last four digits as plain text.<br/>3. Here's how the masking will be applied to the social security number "123-45-6789"<br/>Original: 123-45-6789<br/>Masked: XXX-XX-6789<br/>4. This way, you can achieve the requirement of displaying only the last four digits of the social security number while masking the rest<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/dynamic-data-masking-overview</details>|
|13|You have an Azure SQL Database instance. Database management is performed by an external party. All cryptographic keys are stored in an Azure Key Vault. You must ensure that the external party cannot access the data in the SSN column of the Person Table.<br/>To achieve the requirement, you store column encryption keys in the system catalog view in the database.<br/>Did you achieve the requirement ?<br/><br/>a. Yes<br/>b. No|<details><summary>Answer</summary>b. No<br/><br/>Storing column encryption keys in the system catalog view of the database does not ensure that the external party cannot access the data in the SSN column of the Person Table. The system catalog views in the database are accessible to users with appropriate permissions, and if the external party has the necessary privileges, they could potentially access the keys and decrypt the data.<br/><br/>To achieve the requirement of preventing the external party from accessing the data in the SSN column, you should use Always Encrypted with Azure Key Vault integration. With Always Encrypted, the data in the SSN column is encrypted on the client-side before it is sent to the database. The cryptographic keys required for encryption and decryption are stored securely in Azure Key Vault and are never revealed to the database system or the external party. This way, the database administrators or the external party won't be able to access the sensitive data in the SSN column even if they have access to the database<br/><br/>Always Encrypted provides a strong layer of data protection, and by integrating it with Azure Key Vault, you can ensure that sensitive data remains encrypted and secure from unauthorized access.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/security-overview</details>|
|14|You have an Azure SQL Database instance.<br/>Database management is performed by an external party.<br/>All cryptographic keys are stored in an Azure Key Vault.<br/>You must ensure that the external party cannot access the data in the SSN column of the Person Table.<br/>To achieve the requirement, you enable always encrypted feature.<br/>Did you achieve the requirement ?<br/><br/>a. yes<br/>b. No|<details><summary>Answer</summary>a. Yes<br/><br/>Always Encrypted is a feature designed to protect sensitive data stored in specific database columns from access (for example, credit card numbers, national identification numbers, or data on a need to know basis). This includes database administrators or other privileged users who are authorized to access the database to perform management tasks, but have no business need to access the particular data in the encrypted columns<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/security-overview</details>|

Global caching rule<br/>b. Custom caching rule#1<br/>c. Custom caching rule#2|<details><summary>Answer</summary>c. Custom caching rule#2<br/><br/>Global and custom caching rules are processed in the following order:<br/>Global caching rules take precedence over the default CDN caching behavior (HTTP cache-directive header settings).<br/>Custom caching rules take precedence over global caching rules, where they apply. Custom caching rules are processed in order from top to bottom. That is, if a request matches both conditions, rules at the bottom of the list take precedence over rules at the top of the list. Therefore, you should place more specific rules lower in the list.<br/>Https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/cdn-caching-rules</details>|

|51|You are a developer for HealthEngine Inc., a SaaS company that provides a solution for managing employee expenses. The solution consists of an ASP.NET Core Web API project that is deployed as an Azure Web App.<br/>**Overall architecture -**<br/>Employees upload receipts for the system to process. When processing is complete, the employee receives a summary report email that details the processing results. Employees then use a web application to manage their receipts and perform any additional tasks needed for reimbursement.<br/>**Receipt processing -**<br/>Employees may upload receipts in two ways:<br/>Uploading using an Azure Files mounted folder<br/>Uploading using the web application<br/>**Data Storage -**<br/>Receipt and employee information is stored in an Azure SQL database.<br/>**Documentation -**<br/>Employees are provided with a getting started document when they first use the solution. The documentation includes details on supported operating systems for Azure File upload, and instructions on how to configure the mounted folder.<br/>**Solution details -**<br/>**Users table -**<br/>[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TgHUZnn.png">](https://i.imgur.com/TgHUZnn.png)<br/>**Web Application -**<br/>You enable MSI for the Web App and configure the Web App to use the security principal name WebAppIdentity.<br/>**Processing -**<br/>Processing is performed by an Azure Function that uses version 2 of the Azure Function runtime. Once processing is completed, results are stored in Azure Blob Storage and an Azure SQL database. Then, an email summary is sent to the user with a link to the processing report. The link to the report must remain valid if the email is forwarded to another user.<br/>**Logging -**<br/>Azure Application Insights is used for telemetry and logging in both the processor and the web application. The processor also has TraceWriter logging enabled.<br/>Application Insights must always contain all log messages.<br/>**Requirements -**<br/>**Receipt processing -**<br/>Concurrent processing of a receipt must be prevented.<br/>**Disaster recovery -**<br/>Regional outage must not impact application availability. All DR operations must not be dependent on application running and must ensure that data in the DR region is up to date.<br/>**Security -**<br/>User's SecurityPin must be stored in such a way that access to the database does not allow the viewing of SecurityPins.

They report that when they upload a receipt using the Azure File Share, the receipt does not appear in their profile. When this occurs, they delete the file in the file share and use the web application, which returns a 500 Internal Server error page.<br/>**Capacity issue -**<br/>During busy periods, employees report long delays between the time they upload the receipt and when it appears in the web application.<br/>**Log capacity issue -**<br/>Developers report that the number of log messages in the trace output for the processor is too high, resulting in lost log messages.<br/>**Application code -**<br/>**Processing.cs -**<br/>`PC01 public static class Processing`<br/>`PC02 {`<br/>`PC03     public static class Function`<br/>`PC04     {`<br/>`PC05         [FunctionName("IssueWork")]`<br/>`PC06         public static async Task run([TimerTrigger("0 */5 * * * *")] TimerInfo timer, ILogger log)`<br/>`PC07         {`<br/>`PC08             var container = await GetCloudBlobContainer();`<br/>`PC09             foreach (var fileItem in await ListFiles())`<br/>`PC10             {`<br/>`PC11                 var file = new CloudFile(fileItem.StorageUri.PrimaryUri);`<br/>`PC12                 var ms = new MemoryStream();`<br/>`PC13                 await file.DownloadToStreamAsync(ms);`<br/>`PC14                 var blob = container.GetBlockblobReference(fileItem.Uri.ToString());`<br/>`PC15                 await blob.UploadFromStreamAsync(ms);`<br/>`PC16             }`<br/>`PC17         }`<br/>`PC18         private static CloudBlockBlob GetDRBlob(CloudBlockBlob sourceBlob)`<br/>`PC19         {`<br/>`PC20             ...`<br/>`PC21         }`<br/>`PC22         private async Task<CloudBlobContainer> GetCloudBlobContainer()`<br/>`PC23         {`<br/>`PC24             var CloudBlobClient = new CloudBlobClient(new Uri("..."), await GetCredentials());`<br/>`PC25`<br/>`PC26             await cloudBlobClient.GetRootContainerReference().CreateIfNotExistAsync();`<br/>`PC27             return cloudBlobClient.GetRootContainerReference();`<br/>`PC28         }`<br/>`PC29         private static async Task<StorageCredentials> GetCredentials()`<br/>`PC30         {`<br/>`PC31             ...`<br/>`PC32         }`<br/>`PC33         private static async Task<List<IListFileItem>> ListFiles()`<br/>`PC34         {`<br/>`            ...`<br/>`PC36         }`<br/>`PC37         private KeyVaultClient _KeyVaultClient = new KeyVaultClient("...");`<br/>`PC38     }`<br/>`PC39 }`<br/><br/>**Database.cs -**<br/>`DB01 public class Database`<br/>`DB02 {`<br/>`DB03     private string ConnectionString =`<br/>`DB04 `<br/>`DB05     public async Task<object> LoadUserDetails(string userId)`<br/>`DB06     {`<br/>`DB07 `<br/>`DB08             return await policy.ExecuteAsync(async () =>`<br/>`DB09             {`<br/>`DB10                 using (var connection = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString))`<br/>`DB11                 {`<br/>`DB12                     await connection.OpenAsync();`<br/>`DB13                     using (var command = new SqlCommand("...", connection))`<br/>`DB14                     using (var reader = command.ExecuteReader())`<br/>`DB15                     {`<br/>`DB16                         ...`<br/>`DB17                     }`<br/>`DB18                 }`<br/>`DB19             });`<br/>`DB20     }`<br/>`DB21 }`<br/>**ReceiptUploader.cs -**<br/>`RU01 public class ReceipUploader`<br/>`RU02 {`<br/>`RU03     public async Task UploadFile(string file, byte[] binary)`<br/>`RU04     {`<br/>`RU05         var httpClient = new HttpClient();`<br/>`RU06         var response = await httpClient.PutAsync("...", new ByteArrayContent(binary));`<br/>`RU07         while (ShouldRetry(response))`<br/>`RU08         {`<br/>`RU09             response = await httpClient.PutAsync("...", new ByteArrayContent(binary));`<br/>`RU10         }`<br/>`RU11     }`<br/>`RU12     private bool ShouldRetry(HttpReponseMessage response)`<br/>`RU13     {`<br/>`RU14`<br/>`RU15     }`<br/>`RU16 }`<br/>**ConfigureSSE.ps1 -**<br/>`CS01 $storageAccount = Gt-AzureRmStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName "..." -AccountName "..."`<br/>`CS02 $keyVault = Get-AzureRmKeyVault -VaultName "..."`<br/>`CS03 $key = Get-AzureKeyVaultKey -VaultName $keyVault.VaultName -Name "..."`<br/>`Set-AzureRmKeyVaultAccessPolicy ``\`<br/>`CS05    -VaultName $keyVault.VaultName ``\`<br/>`CS06     -ObjectId $storageAccount.Identity.PrincipalId ``\`<br/>`CS07`<br/>`CS08`<br/>`CS09 set-AzureRmStorageAccount ``\`<br/>`CS10     -ResourceGroupName $storageAccount.ResourceGroupName ``\`<br/>`CS11     -AccountName $storageAccount.StorageAccountName ``\`<br/>`CS12     -EnableEncryptionService File ``\`<br/>`CS13     -KeyvaultEncryption ``\`<br/>`CS14     -KeyName $key.Name ``\`<br/>`CS15     -KeyVersion $key.Version ``\`<br/>`CS16     -KeyVaultUri $keyVault.VaultUri`<br/>**Question**<br/>You need to ensure the security policies are met.<br/>What code do you add at line CS07 of ConfigureSSE.ps1 ?<br/><br/>a.

Use blob properties to prevent concurrency problems<br/>b. Use blob SnapshotTime to prevent concurrency problems<br/>c. Use blob metadata to prevent concurrency problems<br/>d. Use blob leases to prevent concurrency problems|<details><summary>Answer</summary>d. Use blob leases to prevent concurrency problems<br/><br/>Scenario: Processing is performed by an Azure Function that uses version 2 of the Azure Function runtime. Once processing is completed, results are stored in Azure Blob<br/>Storage and an Azure SQL database. Then, an email summary is sent to the user with a link to the processing report. The link to the report must remain valid if the email is forwarded to another user. Concurrent processing of a receipt must be prevented.<br/><br/>Modern applications often have multiple users viewing and updating data simultaneously. Application developers need to think carefully about how to provide a predictable experience to their end users, particularly for scenarios where multiple users can update the same data<br/>To lock a blob for exclusive use, you can acquire a lease on it. When you acquire the lease, you specify the duration of the lease. A finite lease may be valid from between 15 to 60 seconds. A lease can also be infinite, which amounts to an exclusive lock. You can renew a finite lease to extend it, and you can release the lease when you're finished with it. Azure Storage automatically releases finite leases when they expire.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/concurrency-manage?tabs=dotnet</details>|

Code Block3:true<br/><br/>Scenario: Regional outage must not impact application availability. All DR operations must not be dependent on application running and must ensure that data in the DR region is up to date.<br/>The line PC16 is inside a foreach loop. It means that we need to transfer one file at at a time.<br/>SingleTransferContext is for transferring a single file.<br/>ShouldOverwriteCallbackAsync is the valid property of SingleTransferContext<br/>isServiceCopy is a flag indicating whether the copy is service-side asynchronous copy or not. If this flag is set to true, service-side asychronous copy will be used. Ideally to copy a blob, it is better to use service-side asynchronous copy operation.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-data-movement-library</details>|
