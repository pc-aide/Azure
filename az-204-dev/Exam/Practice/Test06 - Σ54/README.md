|1|You develop and deploy a RESTful API to Azure App Service.<br/>You have accessed the API using a browser.<br/>You have received the  below error message.<br/><br/>Failed to load http://api.auzrewebsites.net:60000/#/api/Products: No Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is present on the requested resource.<br/>Origin http://localhost:6000 is therefore not allowed access<br/><br/>What should you do to resolve the error ?<br/><br/>a. Bind an SSL certificate<br/>b. Configure Authentication<br/>c. Enable CORS<br/>d. Add a custom domain<br/>f. Add a CDN|<details><summary>Answer</summary>c. Enable CORS<br/><br/>Because of the domain mismatch between the browser app (http://localhost:6000) and remote resource (http://<app_name>.azurewebsites.net), and the fact that your API in App Service is not sending the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header, your browser has prevented cross-domain content from loading in your browser app. You must enable CORS.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-rest-api#add-cors-functionality</details>|

|5|You are developing a globally distributed application using Azure Cosmos DB. You must ensure that latency must be low for data write operations and require order guarantee between distributed databases.<br/>Which consistency level should you recommend for the database ?<br/><br/>a. Strong<br/>b. Bounded Staleness<br/>c. Session<br/>d. Consistent Prefix<br/>f. Eventual|<details><summary>Answer</summary>b. Bounded Staleness<br/><br/>Bounded staleness is frequently chosen by globally distributed applications that expect low write latencies but require total global order guarantee. The reads are guaranteed to honor the consistent-prefix guarantee. The reads might lag behind writes by at most "K" versions (that is, "updates") of an item or by "T" time interval, whichever is reached first.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/consistency-levels</details>|
|6|You have deployed an application using Azure Container Instance.<br/>Sometimes, application is taking more time for initial load.<br/>You have verified the logs and noticed that your container is taking a long time to start, but eventually succeeding<br/>Which of the below factors would have caused to take a long start time ?<br/><br/>a. Image size<br/>b. Image location<br/>c. Cached images|<details><summary>Answer</summary>a. Image size<br/>b. Image location<br/><br/>If your container takes a long time to start, but eventually succeeds, start by looking at the size of your container image. Because Azure Container Instances pulls your container image on demand, the startup time you see is directly related to its size.<br/>Another way to reduce the impact of the image pull on your container's startup time is to host the container image in Azure Container Registry in the same region where you intend to deploy container instances. This shortens the network path that the container image needs to travel, significantly shortening the download time.<br/>Azure Container Instances uses a caching mechanism to help speed container startup time<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-troubleshooting#issues-during-container-group-runtime</details>|
|7|You are developing an application to process orders. The Azure Web App pushes the order information into an Azure Queue Storage.<br/>You have an Azure Functions App code that process the orders as shown below.<br/><br/>`public static class OrderProcessor`<br/>`{`<br/>`[FunctionName("ProcessOders")]`<br/>`public static void ProcessOrders([QueueTrigger("incoming-orders")]CloudQueueMessage myQueueitem, [Table("Orders")]ICollector<Order> tableBinding,`<br/>`TraceWriter log)`<br/>`{`<br/>`log.Info($"Processing Order: {myQueueItem.Id}");`<br/>`log.Info($"Queue Insertion Time: {myQueueItem.InsertionTime}");`<br/>`log.Info($"Queue Expiration Time: {myQueueItem.ExpirationTime}");`<br/>`tableBindings.Add(JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Order>(myQueueItem.AsString));`<br/>`}`<br/>`[FunctionName("ProcessOrders-Poison")]`<br/>`public static void ProcessFailedOrders([QueueTrigger("incoming-orders-poison")]CloudQueueMessage myQueueItem, TraceWriter log)`<br/>`{`<br/>`logError($"Failed to process order: {myQueueItem.AsString}");`<br/>`...`<br/>`}`<br/>`}`<br/><br/>Select Yes if the below statement is true. Otherwise, select No<br/><br/> 1. The Functions App code will log the time that the order was processed from the queue<br/>2. The function will retry up to five times for a given order, including the first try if the ProcessOrders function fails.<br/>3. When there are multiple orders in the queue, a batch of orders will be retrieved from the queue and the ProcessOrders function will run multiple instances concurrently to process the orders.<br/>4. The output of the ProcessOrders function will move the order to an Orders table in Azure Table Storage<br/><br/>a. Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes<br/>b. No,Yes,Yes,Yes<br/>c. No,No,Yes,Yes<br/>d. yes,No,Yes,Yes<br/>e. Yes,No,No,Yes|<details><summary>Answer</summary>b. No,Yes,Yes,Yes<br/><br/>1.  InsertionTime is the time that the message was added to the queue. Not the order processed time<br/>2. By default, Queue triggers retry requests up to five times. After the fifth retry, both the Azure Queue storage and Azure Service Bus triggers write a message to a poison queue<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-error-pages<br/>3. When there are multiple queue messages waiting, the queue trigger retrieves a batch of messages and invokes function instances concurrently to process them. By default, the batch size is 16.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-storage-queue-trigger?tabs=csharp<br/>4. The output is saved to Orders table in Azure Table Storage</details>|

|50|You are a developer for HealthEngine Inc., a SaaS company that provides a solution for managing employee expenses. The solution consists of an ASP.NET Core Web API project that is deployed as an Azure Web App.<br/>**Overall architecture -**<br/>Employees upload receipts for the system to process. When processing is complete, the employee receives a summary report email that details the processing results. Employees then use a web application to manage their receipts and perform any additional tasks needed for reimbursement.<br/>**Receipt processing -**<br/>Employees may upload receipts in two ways:<br/>Uploading using an Azure Files mounted folder<br/>Uploading using the web application<br/>**Data Storage -**<br/>Receipt and employee information is stored in an Azure SQL database.<br/>**Documentation -**<br/>Employees are provided with a getting started document when they first use the solution. The documentation includes details on supported operating systems for Azure File upload, and instructions on how to configure the mounted folder.<br/>**Solution details -**<br/>**Users table -**<br/>[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TgHUZnn.png">](https://i.imgur.com/TgHUZnn.png)<br/>**Web Application -**<br/>You enable MSI for the Web App and configure the Web App to use the security principal name WebAppIdentity.<br/>**Processing -**<br/>Processing is performed by an Azure Function that uses version 2 of the Azure Function runtime. Once processing is completed, results are stored in Azure Blob Storage and an Azure SQL database. Then, an email summary is sent to the user with a link to the processing report. The link to the report must remain valid if the email is forwarded to another user.<br/>**Logging -**<br/>Azure Application Insights is used for telemetry and logging in both the processor and the web application. The processor also has TraceWriter logging enabled.<br/>Application Insights must always contain all log messages.<br/>**Requirements -**<br/>**Receipt processing -**<br/>Concurrent processing of a receipt must be prevented.<br/>**Disaster recovery -**<br/>Regional outage must not impact application availability. All DR operations must not be dependent on application running and must ensure that data in the DR region is up to date.<br/>**Security -**<br/>User's SecurityPin must be stored in such a way that access to the database does not allow the viewing of SecurityPins. The web application is the only system that should have access to SecurityPins.<br/>All certificates and secrets used to secure data must be stored in Azure Key Vault.<br/>You must adhere to the principle of least privilege and provide privileges which are essential to perform the intended function.<br/>All access to Azure Storage and Azure SQL database must use the application's Managed Service Identity (MSI).<br/>Receipt data must always be encrypted at rest.<br/>All data must be protected in transit.<br/>User's expense account number must be visible only to logged in users. All other views of the expense account number should include only the last segment, with the remaining parts obscured.<br/>In the case of a security breach, access to all summary reports must be revoked without impacting other parts of the system.<br/>**Issues -**<br/>**Upload format issue -**<br/>Employees occasionally report an issue with uploading a receipt using the web application. They report that when they upload a receipt using the Azure File Share, the receipt does not appear in their profile. When this occurs, they delete the file in the file share and use the web application, which returns a 500 Internal Server error page.<br/>**Capacity issue -**<br/>During busy periods, employees report long delays between the time they upload the receipt and when it appears in the web application.<br/>**Log capacity issue -**<br/>Developers report that the number of log messages in the trace output
