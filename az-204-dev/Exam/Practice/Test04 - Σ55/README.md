|5|You are developing a social networking application using Azure Cosmos DB. Your need to record/save the likes and replies for the posts in the social networking application.<br/>The order of replies and likes are not a priority.<br/>Which consistency level is most appropriate ?<br/><br/>a. Strong<br/>b. Bounded Staleness<br/>c. Session<br/>d. Consisten Prefix<br/>e. Eventual|<details><summary>Answer</summary>e. Eventual<br/><br/>Eventual: There's no ordering guarantee for reads. In the absence of any further writes, the replicas eventually converge.<br/>Eventual consistency is the weakest form of consistency because a client may read the values that are older than the ones it had read before. Eventual consistency is ideal where the application does not require any ordering guarantees. Examples include count of Retweets, Likes, or non-threaded comments. The following graphic illustrates the eventual consistency with musical notes.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/consistency-levels</details>|
|6|You have developed an application using Azure Cosmos DB. The application is used by users across the globe. Some of the users have raised a concern on latency issues.<br/>You have reviewed the logs and enabled Multi-write feature in Azure Cosmos DB to fix latency issues.<br/>What changes should you make in your application code ?<br/><br/>a. Set UseMultipleWriteLocations to True<br/>b. SetCurrentLocation to name of the region where application deployed<br/>c. Rewrite data layer access module to handle multi write|<details><summary>Answer</summary>a. Set UseMultipleWriteLocations to True<br/>b. SetCurrentLocation to name of the region where application deployed<br/><br/>Once an account has been created with multiple write regions enabled, you must make two changes in your application to the ConnectionPolicy for the DocumentClient to enable the multi-master and multi-homing capabilities in Azure Cosmos DB. Within the ConnectionPolicy, set UseMultipleWriteLocations to true and pass the name of the region where the application is deployed to SetCurrentLocation. This will populate the PreferredLocations property based on the geo-proximity from location passed in. If a new region is later added to the account, the application does not have to be updated or redeployed, it will automatically detect the closer region and will auto-home on to it should a regional event occur.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-multi-master?tabs=api-async</details>|
|7|You plan to develop a web application using Azure App Service and Azure Cosmos DB. The web application will send data to the database daily. You need to send an email notification when data is received.<br/>What solution should you recommend keeping compute costs minimal ?<br/><br/>a. Create an Azure logic app that has the Azure Cosmos DB connector configured to use a SendGrid action<br/>b. Create a function app using Consumption plan, Cosmos DB trigger & a SendGrid binding<br/>c. Create an Azure Logic app that has a SendGrid connector configured to use an Azure Cosmos DB action<br/>d. Create a function app that is configured to use the Consumption plan & an Azure Event Hubs binding|<details><summary>Answer</summary>b. Create a function app using Consumption plan, Cosmos DB trigger & a sendGrid binding<br/><br/>The Azure Cosmos DB change feed enables efficient processing of large datasets with a high volume of writes. Change feed also offers an alternative to querying an entire dataset to identify what has changed.<br/>Azure Cosmos DB is well-suited for IoT, gaming, retail, and operational logging applications. A common design pattern in these applications is to use changes to the data to trigger additional actions. Examples of additional actions include:<br/>* Triggering a notification or a call to an API, when an item is inserted or updated.<br/>* Real-time stream processing for IoT or real-time analytics processing on operational data.<br/>Data movement such as synchronizing with a cache, a search engine, a data warehouse, or cold storage.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/change-feed-design-patterns<br/><br/><ins>chatGPT</ins><br/>Azure Functions, when configured with the Consumption plan, are billed based on per-execution, so you're not paying for any idle compute time. A Cosmos DB trigger can be used to execute the function when new data is received, and the SendGrid binding can be used to send an email notification when the function is triggered. This setup would only run when new data is received in Cosmos DB, making it a cost-effective solution.</details>|

The Azure Function app is triggered using an output binding on the blob.<br/>The Function app continues to time out after four minutes. The Function app must process the blob data.<br/>You need to implement a solution so that the Function app does not time out and processes the blob data.<br/><br/>You plan to pass the HTTP trigger payload into an Azure Service Bus queue to be processed by a queue trigger function and return an immediate HTTP success response.<br/><br/>Did you achieve the requirement ?<br/><br/>a. yes<br/>b. no|<details><summary>Answer</summary>a. yes<br/><br/>Large, long-running functions can cause unexpected timeout issues. Whenever possible, refactor large functions into smaller function sets that work together and return responses fast. For example, a webhook or HTTP trigger function might require an acknowledgment response within a certain time limit; it's common for webhooks to require an immediate response. You can pass the HTTP trigger payload into a queue to be processed by a queue trigger function. This approach lets you defer the actual work and return an immediate response.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-best-practices</details>|

|28|You plan to develop an application that will be deployed to an Azure virtual machine.<br/>The application connects to external services that are authenticated using a secret key.<br/>You plan to store secret keys in an Azure Key Vault.<br/>Select the authentication method you must consider to read secrets from Key Vault.<br/><br/>a. Service principal & certificate<br/>b. Managed Identity<br/>c. Service principal & secret|<details><summary>Answer</summary>b. Managed Identity<br/><br/>Managed identities for Azure resources: When you deploy an app on a virtual machine in Azure, you can assign an identity to your virtual machine that has access to Key Vault. You can also assign identities to other Azure resources. The benefit of this approach is that the app or service isn't managing the rotation of the first secret. Azure automatically rotates the identity. We recommend this approach as a best practice.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/basic-concepts#authentication</details>
|29|You are developing a web application that will be accessible using application1.azurewebsites.net. The traffic to the web application must be secured with SSL and routed through an Azure Application Gateway.<br/>The Azure application gateway instance is used by multiple applications.<br/><br/>Select the two actions should you perform to configure Azure Application Gateway.<br/><br/>a. Enable the Use for App service setting in the Azure Application Gateway's HTTP settings<br/>b. Convert the web app to run in an Azure App service environment (ASE)<br/>c. Ad authentication certificate to the Azure Application gateway<br/>d. Set the value of the Override backed path option to application1.azurewebsites.net in the Azure Application Gateway's HTTP settings|<details><summary>Answer</summary>a. Enable the Use for App service setting in the Azure Application Gateway's HTTP settings<br/><br/>d. Set the value of the Override backend path option to application1.azurewebsites.net in the Azure Application Gateway's HTTP settings<br/><br/>In multi-tenant architectural designs in web servers, multiple websites are running on the same web server instance. Hostnames are used to differentiate between the different applications which are hosted. Application gateway provides a capability which allows users to override the HTTP host header in the request based on the host name of the back-end. This capability enables support for multi-tenant back ends such as Azure App service web apps and API management<br/>The ability to specify a host override is defined in the HTTP settings and can be applied to any back-end pool during rule creation. The following two ways of overriding host header and SNI extension for multi-tenant back ends is supported: <br/>The ability to set the host name to a fixed value explicitly entered in the HTTP settings. This capability ensures that the host header is overridden to this value for all traffic to the back-end pool where the particular HTTP settings are applied. When using end to end TLS, this overridden host name is used in the SNI extension. This capability enables scenarios where a back-end pool farm expects a host header that is different from the incoming customer host header.<br/>The ability to derive the host name from the IP or FQDN of the back-end pool members. HTTP settings also provide an option to dynamically pick the host name from a back-end pool member's FQDN if configured with the option to derive host name from an individual back-end pool member. When using end to end TLS, this host name is derived from the FQDN and is used in the SNI extension. This capability enables scenarios where a back-end pool can have two or more multi-tenant PaaS services like Azure web apps and the request's host header to each member contains the host name derived from its FQDN. For implementing this scenario, we use a switch in the HTTP Settings called Pick hostname from backend address which will dynamically override the host header in the original request to the one mentioned in the backend pool.<br/>[img src="https://i.imgur.com/tOIkJtk.png">](https://i.imgur.com/tOIkJtk.png)<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-web-app-overview#tls-termination-and-end-to-end-tls-with-multi-tenant-services</details>
