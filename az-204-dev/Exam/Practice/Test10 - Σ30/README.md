Every 5 hours<br/>d. Every 5 minutes|<details><summary>Answer</summary>d. Every 5 minutes<br/><br/>CRON uses a "{second} {minute} {hour} {day} {month} {day-of-week}" format for expressions. The first "0" means that it runs when the second equals 0. The second "*/5" means every 5th minute of every hour, of every day. Refer to Microsoft Doc:<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-timer?tabs=csharp#ncrontab-expressions</details>|
|11|ARM templates are said to have a declarative syntax. Why is a declarative syntax better than a programmatic approach?<br/><br/>a. You don't need to worry about the order of operations to create resources (dependencies), Azure takes care of creating them in the correct order<br/>b. Declarative syntax supports code source control such as Github<br/>c. Declarative syntax only requires minor changes to the code before each deployment to ensure uniqueness<br/>d. Declarative syntax supports advanced techniques such as looping, variables, parameters & random resource names|<details><summary>Answer</summary>a. you don't need to worry about the order of operations to create resources (dependencies), Azure takes care of creating them in the correct order<br/><br/>You don't have to worry about the complexities of ordering operations. Resource Manager orchestrates the deployment of interdependent resources so they're created in the correct order. When possible, Resource Manager deploys resources in parallel so your deployments finish faster than serial deployments. You deploy the template through one command, rather than through multiple imperative commands. Refer to Microsoft Doc: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview</details>|
|12|In ASP.NET Core, using the logger factory class, how do you write a message to the application diagnostics log that only shows up with the user has enabled warning level messages?<br/><br/>a. logger.LogCritical("Message");<br/>b. logger.LogDebug("Message");<br/>c. logger.LogError("Message");<br/>d. logger.LoggerWarning("message");|<details><summary>Answer</summary>d. logger.LogWarning("message");<br/><br/>logger.LogWarning("Message") writes a warning message at log level 3.

|15|What is the major downside/risk to using Spot VMs compared to regularly-provisioned VMs?<br/><br/>a. You are limited to how many spot instances you can have<br/>b. There is no SLA<br/>c. They can cost more than a regularly-provisioned VM<br/>d. Eviction|<details><summary>Answer</summary>d. Eviction<br/><br/>VMs can be evicted based on capacity or the max price you set. When creating an Azure Spot Virtual Machine, you can set the eviction policy to Deallocate (default) or Delete. As well, pricing is variable. Even though there is no SLA (for obvious reasons), this is not the major risk to using spot instances. Your account is limited to the number of any instance type you have per region, and so the limit on spot instances is not different than that. They should cost less than regular VMs though. Refer to Microsoft Doc: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/spot-vms</details>|

When you create a container instance, you can specify a custom DNS name label so your application is reachable at customlabel.azureregion.azurecontainer.io. Refer to Microsoft Doc: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-overview</details>|
|18|Why would someone prefer a Consumption-based pricing model as opposed to a Time-based pricing model?<br/><br/>a. You can easily predict the cost of the service into the future<br/>b. You can save a lot of money if you don't use the resource often as opposed to having it available for use 24/7<br/>c. The pricing model is simpler & easier to understand<br/>d. It is always cheaper to pay for consumption than to pay by the hour|<details><summary>Answer</summary>b. You can save a lot of money if you don't use the resource often as opposed tto having it available for use 24/7<br/><br/>Consumption-Based Model - paying for something based on how much you used, as opposed to paying for something no matter if you use it or not. <br>See: <a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-consumption-costs'>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-consumption-costs</a></details>|
|19|For Linux App Services, where can you choose to have logging saved to?<br/><br/>a. File system, & blob storage<br/>b. File system only<br/>c. File system, blob storage, & Azure Event Hub|<details><summary>Answer</summary>b. File system only<br/><br/>To route messages to log files, Azure Web apps use the Web server (IIS process). Because Windows-based Web apps are a well-established Azure service, and messaging for ASP.NET apps is tightly integrated with the underlying IIS service, Windows apps benefit from a rich logging infrastructure. For other apps, logging options may be limited by the development platform, even when running on a Windows app service. The logging functionality available to Linux-based scripted apps, such as Node, is determined by the Docker image used for the app's container. Basic logging, using redirections to STDERR or STDOUT, uses the Docker logs. Richer logging functionality is dependent on the underlying image, such as whether this is running PHP, Perl, Ruby, and so on. To download equivalent Web application logging as provided by IIS for Windows apps, may require connecting to your container using SSH. Refer to Microsoft Doc: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/capture-application-logs-app-service/2-enable-and-configure-app-service-application-logging</details>|
|20|All Azure data resources (Cosmos DB, SQL Database, Redis Cache, etc) must belong to one and only one.... ?<br/><br/>a. vnet<br/>b. Availability Zone<br/>c. Resource Group<br/>d. AAD Group|<details><summary>Answer</summary>c. Resource Group<br/><br/>Each resource can exist in only one resource group. However, you can move a resource from one resource group to another group. The resources inside the resource group do not have to exist in the same region as the resource group. Refer to Microsoft Doc:<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview</details>|
|21|What is an App Service Plan?<br/><br/>a. A container running inside a VM<br/>b. A set of compute resources for a web app to run<br/>c. An isolated physical environment including network available to your applications & no other Azure customer<br/>d. A serverless environment in which App Services & Funcstions can run|<details><summary>Answer</summary>b. A set of compute resources for a web app to run<br/><br/>In App Service (Web Apps, API Apps, or Mobile Apps), an app always runs in an App Service plan. In addition, Azure Functions also has the option of running in an App Service plan. An App Service plan defines a set of compute resources for a web app to run. These compute resources are analogous to the server farm in conventional web hosting. One or more apps can be configured to run on the same computing resources (or in the same App Service plan). Refer to Microsoft Doc: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans</details>|
|22|You have a Timer Trigger Function that uses "0 0 0 1 1 *" as it's timer setting. How often will the function run?<br/><br/>a. At 1:01 AM every day<br/>b. At 12:01 AM every day<br/>c. At midnight on Jan 1 st only<br/>d. Every Monday at 1:00 AM|<details><summary>Answer</summary>c. At midnight on Jan 1st only<br/><br/>CRON uses a "{second} {minute} {hour} {day} {month} {day-of-week}" format for expressions. The first "0" means that it runs when the second equals 0. The first three "0" means 0:00 or midnight. The fourth "1" means on the 1st day of the month. The fifth "1" means January. So the function triggers once per year, on Jan 1 at midnight. Happy new year! Refer to Microsoft Doc:<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-timer?tabs=csharp#ncrontab-expressions</details>|
