|1|You are a developer for Acme Inc. You are deploying an Azure App Service, and would like to store the application secrets in Azure Key Vault. You would not like to store any user id/passwords at all inside your application. Using what method can you assign the application the permission to read the secrets from the vault, without having to store any type of authentication credentials in code?<br/><br/>a. System-assigned Managged Identity,User-Assigned Managed Identity<br/>b. TLS mutual authentication<br/>c. TLS/SSL Certificate<br/>d. Private Link|<details><summary>Answer</summary>a. system-assigned managed identity,user-assigned managed identity<br/><br/>Azure Key Vault is a service that provides centralized secrets management, with full control over access policies and audit history. In order to read secrets from Key Vault, you need to have a vault created and give your app permission to access it. You must create a managed identity and assign it permissions to read the vault, or you can use a user-assigned identity. Refer to Microsoft Doc:<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-managed-identity?tabs=dotnet</details>|
|2|For Azure Functions, what are the possible values for the direction property in the function.json file?<br/><br/>stderr,stdout,stdin<br/>b. in,out,inout<br/>c. left,right<br/>d. blob,files,queue,table|<details><summary>Answer</summary>b. in,out,inout<br/><br/>All triggers and bindings have a direction property in the function.json file. For triggers, the direction is always in. Input and output bindings use in and out. Some bindings support a special direction inout. If you use inout, only the Advanced editor is available via the Integrate tab in the portal.

|3|You have a new project coming up and the development team would like to use Go as the programming language. At least some of the new project needs to be handled by Azure Functions.

Premium Functions<br/>d. Durable Functions|<details><summary>Answer</summary>a. Custom Handlers<br/><br/>Every Functions app is executed by a language-specific handler. While Azure Functions features many language handlers by default, there are cases where you may want to use other languages or runtimes. Custom handlers are lightweight web servers that receive events from the Functions host. Any language that supports HTTP primitives can implement a custom handler.
