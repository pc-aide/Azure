Users,Sessions,Events<br/><br/>To find out when people use your web app, what pages they're most interested in, where your users are located, and what browsers and operating systems they use. Analyze business and usage telemetry by using Azure Application Insights.<br/>The Users, Sessions, and Events segmentation tool is used to slice and dice telemetry from your web app from three perspectives. By filtering and splitting the data, you can uncover insights about the relative usage of different pages and features.<br/>* Users tool: How many people used your app and its features? Users are counted by using anonymous IDs stored in browser cookies. A single person using different browsers or machines will be counted as more than one user<br/>Sessions tool: How many sessions of user activity have included certain pages and features of your app? A session is counted after half an hour of user inactivity, or after 24 hours of continuous use.<br/>* Events tool: How often certain pages and features of your app are used. A page view is counted when a browser loads a page from your app, provided you have instrumented it.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/usage-segmentation</details>|

Usesrs,Sessions,Events<br/><br/>o find out when people use your web app, what pages they're most interested in, where your users are located, and what browsers and operating systems they use. Analyze business and usage telemetry by using Azure Application Insights<br/>The "Users, Sessions, Events" feature in Application Insights provides information about the users of your application, the sessions they establish, and the events they trigger.<br/>This includes data such as the number of users, the locations of your users (geographic distribution), the browsers and operating systems they use, the number of sessions per user, and the events per session.<br/>So, if you want to know where your users are located and what browsers and operating systems they use, this is the feature to use.<br/>Please note that to get accurate geographic location and system information, your application should collect this data from users and send it to Application Insights. This is usually done by including the appropriate telemetry in your application code.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/usage-segmentation</details>|

X-Cache:TCP_MISS<br/><br/>X-Cache: TCP_MISS - This header is returned when there is a cache miss, and the content is served from the Origin.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/cdn-msft-http-debug-headers<br/>Les termes TCP_HIT et TCP_MISS sont des valeurs de l'en-tête X-Cache utilisées pour indiquer si une requête a été satisfaite à partir du cache (un "hit") ou si elle n'a pas pu être satisfaite à partir du cache et a dû être récupérée de l'origine (un "miss"). Voici une explication plus détaillée de chaque terme:<br/>TCP_HIT: Cela signifie qu'une requête client pour une ressource a été satisfaite à partir du cache du serveur. Autrement dit, la ressource demandée était déjà stockée dans le cache du serveur, ce qui signifie que le serveur n'a pas eu besoin de faire une requête à l'origine pour récupérer la ressource. Ceci est généralement le résultat le plus souhaitable car il permet de servir les ressources plus rapidement et réduit la charge sur le serveur d'origine.<br/>TCP_MISS: Cela signifie qu'une requête client pour une ressource n'a pas pu être satisfaite à partir du cache du serveur et a dû être récupérée de l'origine. Autrement dit, la ressource demandée n'était pas dans le cache du serveur, donc le serveur a dû faire une requête à l'origine pour récupérer la ressource. Ceci est moins souhaitable car il prend plus de temps pour servir la ressource et augmente la charge sur le serveur d'origine.</details>|

Specify custom initialization actions to run the scripts.<br/><br/>Did you achieve the requirement ?<br/><br/>a. yes<br/>b. no|<details><summary>Answer</summary>a. yes<br/><br/>Some apps might require custom warm-up actions before the swap. The applicationInitialization configuration element in web.config lets you specify custom initialization actions. The swap operation waits for this custom warm-up to finish before swapping with the target slot.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-staging-slots#specify-custom-warm-up</details>|
|27|You deploy an API using Azure App Service deployment slot named Development.<br/>You create additional deployment slots named Testing and Production.<br/>You enable auto swap on the Production deployment slot.<br/>You need to ensure that scripts run and resources are available before a swap operation occurs.<br/><br/>To achieve the above requirement, Update the app with a method named statuscheck to run the scripts.<br/>Update the app settings for the app. Set the WEBSITE_SWAP_WARMUP_PING_PATH and WEBSITE_SWAP_WARMUP_PING_STATUSES with a path to the new method and appropriate response codes.<br/><br/>Did you achieve the requirement ?<br/><br/>a. yes<br/>b. no|<details><summary>Answer</summary>a. yes<br/><br/>You can customize the warm-up behavior with one or both of the following app settings:<br/>WEBSITE_SWAP_WARMUP_PING_PATH: The path to ping to warm up your site. Add this app setting by specifying a custom path that begins with a slash as the value. An example is /statuscheck. The default value is /.<br/>WEBSITE_SWAP_WARMUP_PING_STATUSES: Valid HTTP response codes for the warm-up operation. Add this app setting with a comma-separated list of HTTP codes. An example is 200,202 . If the returned status code isn't in the list, the warmup and swap operations are stopped. By default, all response codes are valid.<br/>WEBSITE_WARMUP_PATH: A relative path on the site that should be pinged whenever the site restarts (not only during slot swaps). Example values include /statuscheck or the root path, /.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-staging-slots#specify-custom-warm-up</details>|

Configure IP Restrictions<br/>b. Configure Service EndPoint<br/>c. Change App Service plan to Premium<br/>d. Configure Azure CDN|<details><summary>Answer</summary>a. Configure IP Restrictions<br/><br/>Access restrictions enable you to define a priority ordered allow/deny list that controls network access to your app. The list can include IP addresses or Azure Virtual Network subnets. When there are one or more entries, there is then an implicit "deny all" that exists at the end of the list.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-ip-restrictions#adding-ip-address-rules</details>|
|30|You have a web application deployed into an Azure Web App. The web app is configured with TLS mutual authentication.<br/>You need to validate the client certificate in the web app.<br/>Where should you locate the client certificate ?<br/><br/>a. HTTP Request header<br/>b. Client Cookie<br/>c. HTTP message body<br/>d. URL query string|<details><summary>Answer</summary>a. HTTP Request header<br/><br/>When forwarding the request to your app code with client certificates enabled, App Service injects an X-ARR-ClientCert request header with the client certificate. App Service does not do anything with this client certificate other than forwarding it to your app. Your app code is responsible for validating the client certificate.<br/>For ASP.NET, the client certificate is available through the HttpRequest.ClientCertificate property<br/>For other application stacks (Node.js, PHP, etc.), the client cert is available in your app through a base64 encoded value in the X-ARR-ClientCert request header.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-configure-tls-mutual-auth</details>|
