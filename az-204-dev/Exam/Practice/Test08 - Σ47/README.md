|1|You develop an Azure solution that uses Cosmos DB.<br/>The Cosmos DB container must be replicated and must use a partition key that is optimized for queries.<br/>You need to implement a change feed processor solution to handle each batch of changes.<br/>Which change feed processor should you use?<br/><br/>a. Host<br/>b. Delegate<br/>c. Lease container<br/>d. Monitored container|<details><summary>Answer</summary>b. Delegate<br/><br/>There are four main components of implementing the change feed processor:<br/>1. **The monitored container:**he monitored container has the data from which the change feed is generated. Any inserts and updates to the monitored container are reflected in the change feed of the container.<br/>2. **The lease container**:he lease container acts as a state storage and coordinates processing the change feed across multiple workers. The lease container can be stored in the same account as the monitored container or in a separate account.<br/>3. **the host**:A host is an application instance that uses the change feed processor to listen for changes. Multiple instances with the same lease configuration can run in parallel, but each instance should have a different **instance name**<br/>4. **The delegate**:The delegate is the code that defines what you, the developer, want to do with each batch of changes that the change feed processor reads.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql/change-feed-processor</details>|
|2|You are developing an application that uses Azure Key Vault to store keys, secrets, and certificates.<br/>The application uses the Azure Key Vault APIs.<br/>You need to protect the accidental deletion of the key vault or key vault objects. The objects in the Key vault must be retained for 90 days after deletion.<br/>You need to enable retention period and accidental deletion.<br/>Which Azure Key Vault feature should you use?<br/><br/>a. Access Policy<br/>b. Purge Protection<br/>c. Soft Delete<br/>d. SAS|<details><summary>Answer</summary>c. Soft Delete<br/><br/>Key Vault's soft-delete feature allows recovery of the deleted vaults and deleted key vault objects (for example, keys, secrets, certificates), known as soft-delete.<br/>Specifically, we address the following scenarios: This safeguard offer the below protection.<br/>Once a secret, key, certificate, or key vault is deleted, it will remain recoverable for a configurable period of 7 to 90 calendar days. If no configuration is specified the default recovery period will be set to 90 days. This provides users with sufficient time to notice an accidental secret deletion and respond.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/soft-delete-overview</details>|
|3|You are developing an application that uses Azure Key Vault to store keys, secrets, and certificates.<br/>The application uses the Azure Key Vault APIs.<br/>You need to protect the accidental deletion of the key vault or key vault objects. The objects in the Key vault must be retained for 90 days after deletion.<br/>You need to enforce retention period and accidental deletion.<br/>Which Azure Key Vault feature should you use?<br/><br/>a. Access Policy<br/>b. Purge Protection<br/>c. Soft Delete<br/>d. SAS|<details><summary>Answer</summary>b. Purge Protection<br/><br/>When purge protection is on, a vault or an object in the deleted state cannot be purged until the retention period has passed. Soft-deleted vaults and objects can still be recovered, ensuring that the retention policy will be followed.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/soft-delete-overview#purge-protection</details>|
|4|You develop an application that uses a user delegation SAS token to communicate with Azure Blob storage.<br/>You suspect that the token is compromised.<br/>You need to revoke the token.<br/>What are two possible ways to achieve this goal?<br/><br/>a. Revoke the delegation key<br/>b. Delete the stored access policy<br/>c. Regenerate the account key<br/>d. Remove the role assignment for the security principal|<details><summary>Answer</summary>a. Revoke the delegation key<br/>d. Remove the role assignment for the security principale<br/><br/>If you believe that a SAS has been compromised, then you should revoke the SAS. You can revoke a user delegation SAS either by revoking the user delegation key, or by changing or removing RBAC role assignments for the security principal used to create the SAS.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/create-user-delegation-sas#revoke-a-user-delegation-sas</details>|
|5|You plan to develop a solution that uses a multi-partitioned Azure Cosmos DB database.<br/>You plan to use the latest Azure Cosmos DB SDK for development.<br/><br/>The solution must satisfy the below requirements:<br/>Send insert and update operations to an Azure Blob storage account.<br/>Immediately process changes to all partitions.<br/>Allow parallelization of change processing.<br/><br/>You need to process the Azure Cosmos DB operations. What are two possible ways to achieve this goal?<br/><br/>a. Create an Azure App Service API & implement the change feed estimator of the SDK.Scale the API by using multiple Azure App Service instances<br/>b. Create a background job in an Azure Kubernetes Service & implement the change feed feature of the SDK<br/>c. Create an Azure Function to use a trigger for Azure Cosmos DB.Configure the trigger to connect to the container<br/>d. Create an Azure Function that uses a FeedIterator object that processes the change feed by using the pull model on the container.Use a FeedRange object to parallelize the processing of the change feed across multiple functions|<details><summary>Answer</summary>c. Create an Azure Function to use a trigger for Azure Cosmos DB. Configure the trigger to connect to the container<br/>d. Create an Azure Function that uses a Feedterator object that processes the change feed by using the pull model on the container. Use a FeedRange object to parallelize the processing of the change feed across multiple functions<br/><br/>You can work with the Azure Cosmos DB change feed using either a push model or a pull model. With a push model, the change feed processor pushes work to a client that has business logic for processing this work.<br/><br/>There are two ways you can read from the change feed with a push model: Azure Functions Cosmos DB triggers and the change feed processor library. Azure Functions uses the change feed processor behind the scenes, so these are both very similar ways to read the change feed.<br/><br/>The change feed pull model allows you to consume the change feed at your own pace. Changes must be requested by the client and there is no automatic polling for changes. Using the change feed pull model, you get more low level control of the change feed. When reading the change feed with the pull model, you have three options:<br/>* Rad changes for an entire container<br/>* Read changes for a specific FeedRange<br/>* Read changes for a specific partition key value<br/><br/>In the change feed pull model, you can use the FeedRange to parallelize the processing of the change feed. A FeedRange represents a range of partition key values.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql/read-change-feed<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql/change-feed-pull-model#using-feedrange-for-parallelization</details>|
|6|You have several functions in an Azure Function app that uses the latest runtime host. The Azure Function app runs in a Consumption plan.<br/>The functions contain several REST API endpoints secured by using SSL.<br/>You need to monitor the availability and responsiveness of the functions.<br/>An email alert must be sent when any of the function endpoints are unavailable or responding too slowly.<br/>What should you do?<br/><br/>a. Create a URL ping test<br/>b. Create a timer triggered function that calls TrackAvailability() & send the results to Application Insights<br/>c. Create a timer triggered function that calls Getmetric("Request Size") & send the results to Application Insights<br/>d. Add a new diagnostic setting to the Azure Function app.Enable the FunctionAppLogs & Send to Log Analytics options|<details><summary>Answer</summary>a. Create a URL ping test<br/><br/>The URL ping test uses advanced HTTP request functionality to validate whether an endpoint is responding. They measure the performance associated with that response. They also add the ability to set custom success criteria, coupled with more advanced features like parsing dependent requests and allowing for retries.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/monitor-web-app-availability#actions-if-you-see-failures</details>|

CodeBlock3:5<br/><br/>Scenario: Calls to the Printer API App fail periodically due to printer communication timeouts.<br/>Printer communication timeouts occur after 10 seconds.<br/>The label printer must only receive up to 5 attempts within one minute.<br/>To specify that the action or trigger waits the specified interval before sending the next request, set the <retry-policy-type> to fixed.<br/>The printer app must receive upto 5 attempts only. It means fixed number re-tries per minute. So maximum number of retries are 5. Count provides the number of retry attempts.<br/>The timeout occurs after 10 seconds. So, retry interval value can be anything more than 10 Seconds. In this case, if we set to 30 seconds, then number of retries will be less than 5 per minute.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-exception-handling?tabs=consumption</details>|
