|4|What method of provisioning a non-relational database involves first defining the database in a JSON file, which can then be checked into a code repository for source control, sometimes also referred to as Infrastructure as Code?<br/><br/>a. CLI Bash Shell<br/>b. ARM templates<br/>c. Azure Portal<br/>d. PowerShell Scripts|<details><summary>Answer</summary>b. ARM templates<br/><br/>ARM templates are a way of defining your infrastructure using declaritive statements, as opposed to scripts. You define what you want your resources to look like, including the properties and values, and Azure will ensure they look that way. Scripts suffer from the problem of not being able to run the same script twice, whereas ARM templates can be deployed again and again without issue. This is sometimes called Desired State Configuration (or DSC). Refer to Microsoft Doc: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/explore-provision-deploy-non-relational-data-services-azure/2-describe-provision-non-relational-data-services</details>|

|8|You are developer encountering an issue with your Azure App Service web app. The app appears to be failing to connect to the database. You notice that the connection string appears both in the <connectionStrings> section of web.config AND ALSO appears in the Connection Strings tab of the App Service configuration. Which database connection string is being used by the application in production?<br/><br/>a. The Connection String in the web.config<br/>b. There's no way to know why connection string will be chosen<br/>c. The Connection Strings tab of the App Service configuration|<details><summary>Answer</summary>c. The Connection Strings tab of the App Service configuration<br/><br/>For ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core developers, setting connection strings in App Service are like setting them in <connectionStrings> in Web.config, but the values you set in App Service override the ones in Web.config. You can keep development settings (for example, a database file) in Web.config and production secrets (for example, SQL Database credentials) safely in App Service. The same code uses your development settings when you debug locally, and it uses your production secrets when deployed to Azure. Refer to Microsoft Doc: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-common#configure-connection-strings</details>|
|9|When deploying an Azure Storage account, and you choose Locally Redundant Storage (LRS), how many copies of your data does Azure keep?<br/><br/>a. 1 copy in each Availability Zone<br/>b. 1<br/>c. 3<br/>d. 6|<details><summary>Answer</summary>c. 3<br/><br/>Azure Storage always stores multiple copies of your data so that it is protected from planned and unplanned events, including transient hardware failures, network or power outages, and massive natural disasters. Redundancy ensures that your storage account meets its availability and durability targets even in the face of failures. Locally redundant storage (LRS) copies your data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the primary region. LRS is the least expensive replication option, but is not recommended for applications requiring high availability or durability. Refer to Microsoft Doc: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy</details>|

Refer to Microsoft Doc: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/vscode-create-service-instance</details>|
|11|Which of the following is a negative consequence of running Azure Functions in the Consumption service plan?<br/><br/>a. Performance is not as good as an App Service Plan<br/>b. Functions can only be developed inside the Portal & not locally<br/>c. It's the most expensive way to run Functions<br/>d. The cold start problem|<details><summary>Answer</summary>d. The cold start problem<br/><br/>Azure Functions Broadly speaking, the cold start problem is a term used to describe the phenomenon that applications that haven’t been used take longer to start up. In the context of Azure Functions, latency is the total time a user must wait for their function. From when an event happens to start up a function until that function completes responding to the event. So more precisely, a cold start is an increase in latency for Functions that haven’t been called recently. When using Azure Functions in the dedicated plan, the Functions host is always running, which means that cold start isn’t really an issue. So, our scope is narrowed to Functions running the serverless consumption model.<br/>Refer to the Microsoft Doc: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/understanding-serverless-cold-start/</details>|
|12|True or false: you can create an Azure Function to run whenever a new email comes into Outlook using it's own native Trigger integration with email<br/><br/>a. FALSE<br/>b. TRUE|<details><summary>Answer</summary>a. False<br/><br/>You cannot get an Azure Function to trigger off an incoming email.</details>|
|13|What security feature exists for API apps that will either allow or prevent applications running from other domains (external websites) from calling the API?<br/><br/>a. RBAC<br/>b. AAD<br/>c. Cross Site Scripting (XSS)<br/>d. Cros-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)|<details><summary>Answer</summary>d. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)<br/><br/>Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a standard with web browsers that will prevent a website from calling an API in the browser unless the API explicitly allows the call.</details>|
|14|What does the Change Feed do when configured in Azure Cosmos DB?<br/><br/>a. Sends an alert to Azure Portal notifications when data changes in Cosmos DB<br/>b. Sends an alert to an Action Group (SMS,Email,Funcstion,etc) when data changes in Cosmos DB<br/>c. It outputs a sorted list of documents that were changed in the order in which they were modified<br/>d. Outputs a list of documents in the container, along with the date they were last modified|<details><summary>Answer</summary>c. It outputs a sorted list of documents that were changed in the order in which they were modified<br/><br/>Change feed in Azure Cosmos DB is a persistent record of changes to a container in the order they occur. Change feed support in Azure Cosmos DB works by listening to an Azure Cosmos container for any changes. It then outputs the sorted list of documents that were changed in the order in which they were modified. The persisted changes can be processed asynchronously and incrementally, and the output can be distributed across one or more consumers for parallel processing. Refer to Microsoft Doc: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/change-feed</details>|
|15|What feature of Azure Blob Storage, if enabled, allows you to retrieve files that have previously been deleted within a time period?<br/><br/>a. Change Feed<br/>b. Soft Delete<br/>c. Azure Policy<br/>d. Immutable blobs|<details><summary>Answer</summary>b. Soft Delete<br/><br/>Soft Delete allows you to recover deleted files within a set time period as configured. Change Feed would not allow you to recover deleted files. Immutable blobs can restrict deletion but not help you recover files. And Azure Policy does not have an option that deals with the contents of a storage account. Refer to Microsoft Doc:<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/explore-non-relational-data-offerings-azure/3-explore-azure-blob-storage</details>|
|16|Which types of database changes does the CosmosDB change feed track?<br/><br/>a. Inserts,updates & deletes<br/>b. Insers & updates<br/>c. Updates only<br/>d. Insers only|<details><summary>Answer</summary>b. Inserts & updates<br/><br/>Today, you see all inserts and updates in the change feed. You can't filter the change feed for a specific type of operation. One possible alternative is to add a "soft marker" on the item for updates and filter based on that when processing items in the change feed. Currently, the change feed doesn't log deletes. Similar to the previous example, you can add a soft marker on the items that are being deleted. For example, you can add an attribute in the item called "deleted" and set it to "true" and set a TTL on the item so that it can be automatically deleted.  You can read the change feed as far back as the origin of your container, but if an item is deleted, it will be removed from the change feed.<br/>Refer to Microsoft Doc: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/change-feed</details>|
|17|Which CosmosDB API format works best with key-value data?<br/><br/>a. Cassandra API<br/>b. MongoDB API<br/>c. Table API<br/>d. Gremlin API|<details><summary>Answer</summary>c. Table API<br/><br/>Table API stores data in key/value format. Gremlin API allows users to make graph queries and stores data as edges and vertices. Cassandra API stores data in column-oriented schema. MongoDB API stores data in a document structure, via BSON format. Refer to Microsoft Doc: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction</details>|

|24|You have one application installed in an App Service Plan Standard S1 Tier. You have manually scaled it out to two instances. This application also has one WebJob running in the background to support it. How many VMs are running to support this?<br/><br/>a. One<br/>b. Two<br/>c. Four<br/>d. Three|<details><summary>Answer</summary>b. Two<br/><br/>When you create an app in App Service, it is put into an App Service plan. When the app runs, it runs on all the VM instances configured in the App Service plan. If multiple apps are in the same App Service plan, they all share the same VM instances. If you have multiple deployment slots for an app, all deployment slots also run on the same VM instances. In this way, the App Service plan is the scale unit of the App Service apps. If the plan is configured to run five VM instances, then all apps in the plan run on all five instances. If the plan is configured for autoscaling, then all apps in the plan are scaled out together based on the autoscale settings. Refer to Microsoft Doc: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans</details>|
|25|You have created a web app called TestWebApp in the West US region. After creating it, you decide you'd rather this web app run in the East US region. How do you move a Web App to a new region?<br/><br/>a. You can't. If you want to move an app between regions, you must clone the app, or redeploy the app from scratch<br/>b. It can only be done in PowerShell or CLI<br/>c. In the Azure Portal, open the Web App, & choose the Move menu at the top of the Overview screen<br/>d. You can't move the web app, but you can move the App Service Plan it runs in which has the same effect|<details><summary>Answer</summary>a. you can't. If you want to move an app between regions, you must clone the app, or redeploy the app from scratch<br/><br/>You can move an app to another App Service plan as long as the source plan and the target plan are in the same resource group and geographical region. The region in which your app runs is the region of the App Service plan it's in. However, you cannot change an App Service plan's region. If you want to run your app in a different region, one alternative is app cloning. Cloning copies your app in a new or existing App Service plan in any region<br/>Refer to Microsoft Doc: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-plan-manage</details>|
|26|Your Azure Container Registry is getting quite big. You have to find a way to reduce the size of it by removing unused images. You decided to delete any untagged images after 30 days.
