|17|You have to develop an application that is going to access Blob storage. The application is going to run on an Azure virtual machine. The application needs to use Azure Managed Identity to access the storage service.

The response content is a JSON string containing various details including the access token. To extract the access token, we need to deserialize the JSON string into a dictionary and then we can easily access the token by its key. Newtonsoft.Json's JsonConvert.DeserializeObject method is commonly used for this task.</details>|

|24|You are developing a web application that is going to interact with Blob storage in an Azure Storage account. You have created an Application Object in Azure AD. The web application will make use of this application object. Users will log into the application via their Azure AD credentials. Those credentials will then be used to access the objects stored in blob storage. You need to set the right permission and type when it comes to setting the API permission for blob storage for the Azure AD application object.<br/>Which of the following would you set as the permission type ?<br/>a. Application<br/>b. Delegated|<details><summary>Answer</summary>b. Delegated<br/><br/>Since here the application would make use of the permissions assigned to the user to access blob storage, we need to make use of delegated permissions.<br/><br/>Delegated permissions are used by apps that have a signed-in user present (in this case, the Azure AD users). For these apps, either the user or an administrator consents to the permissions that the app requests, and the app is delegated permission to act as the signed-in user when making calls to the target resource (here, the Blob Storage). This means that the access token the app acquires contains the permissions (scopes) the user has granted to the app and that the app can use to access the resources.<br/>On the other hand, application permissions are used by apps that run without a signed-in user present; for example, apps that run as background services or daemons. Application permissions can only be consented by an administrator.</details>|
|25|You are developing a web application that is going to interact with Blob storage in an Azure Storage account. You have created an Application Object in Azure AD. The web application will make use of this application object. Users will log into the application via their Azure AD credentials. Those credentials will then be used to access the objects stored in blob storage. You need to set the right permission and type when it comes to setting the API permission for blob storage for the Azure AD application object.<br/>Which of the following would you use as the permission ?<br/><br/>a. user.Read<br/>b. user.Write<br/>c. user_impersonation|<details><summary>Answer</summary>c. user_impersonation<br/><br/>The user_impersonation scope is an OAuth 2.0 scope that allows an application to act as the signed-in user when calling the API. It means that the app can access resources on behalf of the user, with the same permissions as the user.Please note, however, that to access Azure Blob Storage, you also need to grant permissions to your application in Azure AD to access the Azure Storage APIs. You can do this by adding the necessary API permissions for Azure Storage in the Azure AD app registration. The required permissions would depend on the operations your application needs to perform in Blob Storage.<br/><br/>As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Azure Storage supports Azure AD authorization for Blob and Queue data operations using OAuth 2.0 tokens. The Azure AD OAuth 2.0 token must contain the Azure Storage service or user delegation scopes.<br/><br/>Note: "user.Read" and "user.Write" are often related to the user's profile or directory information, not specifically to Blob storage.</details>|
|26|You need to provision an Azure Cosmos DB account.

DocumentDB Accounts Contributor<br/>b. Cosmos Backup Operator<br/>c. Cosmos DB Operator<br/>d. Cosmos DB Account Reader|<details><summary>Answer</summary>c. Cosmos DB Operator<br/><br/>With the Cosmos DB operator role, one can manage the database and containers in the Cosmos DB account, but they can’t access the data.<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#documentdb-account-contributor</details>|

The solution is an ecommerce solution that will process orders. The orders would be sent to a topic. And different subscriptions need to be created based on the order requirement.<br/>The message that would be sent to the topic would have the following properties<br/>1) OrderId – This is the unique id of the order. This would be set as the message id for the message<br/>2) Quantity – This is the quantity for the order. This would be a custom property in the message<br/>3) Priority – This could have a value of either High, Medium or Low. This would be a custom property in the message.<br/>Below are the requirements<br/>1) SubscriptionA – This subscription will accept all orders<br/>2) SubscriptionB – This subscription will accept only those orders that have a priority value of High<br/>3) SubscriptionC – This subscription will accept only those orders that have a minimum quantity of 50.<br/><br/>Which would be the best filter that should be used by SubscriptionB for this requirement ?<br/><br/>a.
