|5|Your team is planning on using Azure Cosmos DB as their data store. The store needs to be able to store relational data. Which of the following API can be used for this requirement?<br/><br/>a. MongoDB API<br/>b. Table API<br/>c. SQL API<br/>d. Cassandra API|<details><summary>Answer</summary>c. SQL API<br/><br/>Even though Azure Cosmos DB is primarily used as a NoSQL data store, you can also implement ways to store relational data to an extent. This can be done with the use of the SQL API.

|6|Your team is planning on creating several Azure Cosmos DB accounts. Each account has a different requirement when it comes to the consistency of data within the account. Which consistency level should be considered for the following requirement?<br/>"Here it needs to ensured that always the most recent version of an item is retrieved”<br/><br/>a. Strong<br/>b. Eventual<br/>c. Bounded staleness<br/>d. Consistent prefix|<details><summary>Answer</summary>a. Strong<br/><br/>Here since the most recent version needs to be retrieved , we need to choose the consistency level of Strong.
