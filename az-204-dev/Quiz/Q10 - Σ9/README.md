|7|Your company currently has the following Azure API management instance in place.<br/>[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/epwaXwE.png">](https://i.imgur.com/epwaXwE.png)<br/>An Azure Web App instance is currently hosting a set of APIs. The API’s have been configured to sit behind the Azure API Management instance. All calls made to the API’s need to be authenticated via the use of OAuth.<br/>You need to implement a policy in Azure API management to implement caching. The caching would be based on the following requirement<br/>1) The policy needs to ensure that the user id’s profile is cached.<br/>2) The user id needs to be picked up from the Authorization header of the request.<br/>3) The response body should then be replaced with the user’s profile.<br/>In which section of the policy would you use the set-variable policy definition ?<br/><br/>a. inbound<br/>b. outbound<br/>c. backend|<details><summary>Answer</summary>a. inbound<br/><br/>This needs to be set in the inbound policy section. An example of this is also given in the below documentation link - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-sample-cache-by-key</details>|
