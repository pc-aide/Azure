If you want to send data to more than one of a particular destination type (for example, two different Log Analytics workspaces), then create multiple settings. Each resource can have up to 5 diagnostic settings<br/><br/>**Note**: Diagnostic settins are used to configure streaming export of platform logs & metrics for a resource to the destionation of your choice.

|5|You configure the Diagnostics settings for an Azure database as shown in the following exhibit<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zSybfq2.png"><br/>Please select the answer choice that completes the following statement based on the information presented in the graphic<br/><br/>To perform real-time reporting by using Microsoft Power BI, you must first ...<br/><br/>a. clear Send to Log Analytics<br/>b. clear SQLInsights<br/>c. select Archive to a storage account<br/>d. select Stream to an event hub|<details><summary>Answer</summary>.d select Stream to an event hub<br/><br/>You can stream Azure SQL Database & Azure SQL Managed Instance metrics & resource logs into Event Hubs by using the built-in Stream to an event hub option in the Azure portal. You also can enable the Service Bus rule ID by using diagnostics settings via PowerShell cmdlet, the Azure CLI, or the Azure Monitor REST API<br/><br/>After the selected data is streamed into Event Hubs, you're one step closer to enabling advanced monitoring scenarios. Event Hubs acts as the front door for an event pipeline. After data is collected into an event hub, it can be transformed & stored by using a real-time analytics provider or a storage adapter. Event Hubs decouples the production of a stream of events from the consumption of those events. In this way, event consumers can access the events on their own schedule<br/><br/>By using Event Hubs, Stream Analytics, & Power BI, you can easily transform your metrics & diagnostics data into near real-time insights on your Azure services<br/>ref:<br/>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/metrics-diagnostic-telemetry-logging-streaming-export-configure?view=azuresql&tabs=azure-portal#stream-into-event-hubs</details>|

Azure Analysis Services<br/>b. Azure Application Insights<br/>c. Azure SQL Analytics<br/>d. Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)<br/>e. SQL Health Check|<details><summary>Answer</summary>c. Azure SQL Analytics<br/><br/>Azure SQL Analytics is an advanced cloud monitoring solution for monitoring performance of all your Azure SQL databases at scale & across multiple subscriptions in a single view. Azure SQL Analytics collects & visualizes key performance metrics with built-in intelligence for performance troubleshooting<br/><br/>By using these collected metrics, you can create custom monitoring rules & alerts. Azure SQL Analytics helps you identify issues at each layer of your application stack. It uses Azure Diagnostic metrics along with Azure Monitor views to present data about all your Azure SQL databases in a single Log Analytics workspace. Azure Monitor helps you to collect, correlate, & visualize structured & unstructured data<br/>ref:<br/>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/azure/azure-monitor/insights/azure-sql</details>|
