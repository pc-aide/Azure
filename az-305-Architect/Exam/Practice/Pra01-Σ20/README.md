Azure SQL Analytics collects & visualizes key performance metrics with built-in intelligence for performance troubleshooting<br/><br/>By using these collected metrics, you can create custom monitoring rules & alerts. Azure SQL Analytics helps you identify issues at each layer of your application stack. It uses Azure Diagnostic metrics along with Azure Monitor views to present data about all your Azure SQL databases in a single Log Analytics workspace. Azure Monitor helps you to collect, correlate, & visualize structured & unstructured data<br/>ref:<br/>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/azure/azure-monitor/insights/azure-sql</details>|
|7|You plan to deploy an application named App1 that will run five Azure virtual machines. Additional virtual machines will be deployed later to run App1<br/><br/>You need to recommend a solution to meet the following requirements for the virtual machines that will run App1<br/><br/>Ensure that the virtual machines can authenticate to AAD to gain access to an Azure Key vault. Azure Logic Apps instances, & an Azure SQL database<br/><br/>Avoid assigning new roles & permissions for Azure services when you deploy additional virtual machines<br/><br/>Avoid storing secrets & certificates on the virtual machines<br/><br/>Minimize administrative effort for managing identities<br/><br/>Which type of identity should you include in the recommendation?<br/><br/>a. a service principal that is configured to use a certificate<br/>b. a system-assigned managed identity<br/>c. a service principal that is configured to use a client secret<br/>d. a user-assigned managed identity|<details><summary>Answer</summary>d. a user-assigned managed identity<br/><br/>**Authentication to Azure Services** : Both system-assigned and user-assigned managed identities can authenticate to Azure services like Azure Key Vault, Azure Logic Apps, and Azure SQL databases. They provide Azure AD tokens for this purpose.<br/><br/>**Avoid Assigning New Roles & Permissions** :User-assigned managed identities are ideal for scenarios where you need to avoid repeatedly assigning roles and permissions each time new resources are deployed. Once a user-assigned managed identity is granted access to a resource, any VM or service that uses this identity inherits that access. This fulfills your requirement of not having to assign new roles and permissions when new VMs are deployed<br/><br/>**Avoid Storing Secrets & Certificates on VMs:** Managed identities eliminate the need for storing credentials directly on your virtual machines. They automatically handle the management of credentials.<br/><br/>**Minimize Administrative Effort** : User-assigned managed identities reduce the administrative effort in managing identities. Unlike system-assigned identities, which are tied to the lifecycle of a single resource (like a VM), user-assigned identities are separate Azure resources. They can be managed independently and used by multiple resources, simplifying identity management as your environment scales<br/><br/>In contrast, service principals (options a and c) require more management overhead, particularly in handling the lifecycle of the secrets or certificates they use for authentication. System-assigned managed identities (option b) are simpler but are directly tied to the lifecycle of a single resource, which can complicate scenarios where you are deploying additional resources that need the same identity.<br/>ref:<br/>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview</details>|

Azure App Gateway with Azure WAF<br/>b. Azure API Management Premium tier with virtual network connection<br/>c. Azure API Management Standard tier with a service endpoint<br/>d. Azure Front Door with Azure WAF|<details><summary>Answer</summary>b. Azure API Management Premium tier with virtual network connection<br/><br/>One option is to deploy APIM (API Managemen) inside the cluster vnet<br/><br/>The AKS cluster & the applications that consume the microservices might reside within the same vnet, hence there is no reason to expose the cluster publicly as all API traffic will remain within the vnet. For these scenarios, you can deploy API Management into the cluster vnet. API Management Premium tier support vnet deployment<br/><br/>**Incorrect Answers:**<br/>a. Azure App Gateway with WAF<br/>App Gateway does not support rate limiting<br/>c. Azure API Management Standard tier with a service endpoint<br/>The AKS cluster & applications that consume the microservice might reside within the same vnet. API Management Premium tier supports vnet deployment & rate limiting<br/>d.
