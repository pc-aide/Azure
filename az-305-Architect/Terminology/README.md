|5|Management Identity|<details><summary>system-assigned managed identity</summary>A system-assigned managed identity is an identity that is automatically created by Azure to enable secure access control for Azure resources. It's a feature of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) that provides Azure services with an automatically managed identity. This identity can be used to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, without needing to embed credentials in your code. When you enable a system-assigned managed identity for an Azure service instance, Azure creates an identity for the instance in the Azure AD tenant that's trusted by the subscription. This identity is tied to the lifecycle of the resource and is automatically deleted if the resource is deleted. This makes it an efficient and secure way to manage credentials and access for your Azure resources.</details><details><summary>user-assigned managed identity</summary>A user-assigned managed identity is a type of managed identity in Azure that provides Azure services with an Azure Active Directory identity, which can be used for authentication and authorization purposes. Unlike a system-assigned managed identity, which is directly tied to a specific Azure service instance and is managed by Azure, a user-assigned managed identity is created as a standalone Azure resource. This means it can be created independently of specific service instances and can be assigned to one or more Azure services as needed.<br/><br/>User-assigned managed identities are designed for scenarios where you need a more flexible identity management solution, allowing for the reuse of the same identity across multiple resources. This can simplify the management of credentials for services that need to access or be accessed by other Azure services. Since the identity is managed by Azure Active Directory, it eliminates the need for developers to manage credentials in their code, thereby enhancing security. The lifecycle of a user-assigned managed identity is managed by the user, meaning it does not automatically get deleted when the Azure service it's assigned to is deleted. This allows for more persistent and versatile management of access controls and permissions across your Azure environment.</details>||<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UH3rYMm.png">|

|8|Reservations|"Reservations" blade is a feature that allows users to reserve resources in advance, typically for one or three years, in exchange for a significantly discounted rate compared to pay-as-you-go pricing. This reservation model can be applied to several types of Azure services, such as virtual machines, SQL databases, Azure Cosmos DB, and others.||<img src="https://i.imgur.com/A0gmoBD.png">|
