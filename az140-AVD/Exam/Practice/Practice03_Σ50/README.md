|48|Your organization has implemented Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) to support remote work for employees who use a mix of Windows, macOS, and mobile devices. As part of the AVD configuration, the organization wants to enable device redirection to allow users to access local resources, such as USB drives, from their AVD sessions. However, they also want to ensure that security is not compromised. Which of the following configurations best balances the need for device redirection with security considerations?<br/><br/>a. Enable device redirection for all devices by configuring the AVD environment to allow redirection of all supported device types, while implementing Azure Information Protection to secure sensitive data<br/><br/>b. Eanble device redirection for Windows & macOS devices only, disabling redirection for mobile devices, & implement Azure Information Protection to secure sensitive data accessed from redirected devices<br/><br/>c. Implement selective device redirection by configuring the AVD environmlent to allow redirection of specific device types, such as storage devices, while blocking redirection for other device types that may pose security risks<br/><br/>d. Configure device redirection on a per-device basis, allowing only specific, pre-approved devices to be redirected in the AVD environment, & use AAD conditional access policies to control access|<details><summary>Answer</summary>True</details>|
