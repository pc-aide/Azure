|6|PHS|Password Hash Synchronization|Password Hash Synchronization (PHS): In this scenario, user password hashes are synchronized from a local directory (such as Active Directory) to a cloud service (for example, Azure Active Directory). This means that the password hash stored in the cloud is identical to the one stored locally.<br/><br/>Seamless Single Sign-On (SSO): This allows users to log in to their applications and services without having to re-enter their password after the initial authentication. Authentication occurs seamlessly, usually using tokens or cookies, providing a smooth and seamless experience.|
|7|ppk|Putty Private Key File|
|8|PTA|Pass-Through Authentication|Pass-Through Authentication (PTA): In this case, user authentication is performed directly by the local domain controller (for example, Active Directory). When a user attempts to log in to a cloud service, the authentication request is passed to the local domain controller, which verifies the credentials.<br/><br/>Seamless Single Sign-On (SSO): Just like in the first scenario, the goal is to provide a seamless login experience for users, eliminating the need to log in multiple times.|<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zEx6nJo.png">|
