|7|PHS|Password Hash Synchronization|Password Hash Synchronization (PHS): In this scenario, user password hashes are synchronized from a local directory (such as Active Directory) to a cloud service (for example, Azure Active Directory). This means that the password hash stored in the cloud is identical to the one stored locally.<br/><br/>Seamless Single Sign-On (SSO): This allows users to log in to their applications and services without having to re-enter their password after the initial authentication.
