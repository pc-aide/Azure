|1|Azure Blueprints|* Azure Blueprints enables cloud architects & central information technology groups to define a repeatable set of Azue resources that implements & adheres to an organization's standards, patterns, & requirements<br/><br/>* The Azure Blueprints service is designed to help with environment setup, which often consists of a set of resource groups, policies, role assignments, & Resource Manager template deployments. A blueprint is a package to bring each of these artifact types together<details><summary>eg - IAM Role - admLocal login for new VM</summary><ins>Create blueprint</ins><br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DsXWCp9.png"><br/><ins>Artifacts:<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pc24zWs.png"><br/>Role : virtual machine administrator login:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wzUOgSP.png"><br/>Publish blueprint:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DiqxmEc.png"><br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cAA0NrC.png"><br/>Assign blueprint:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mxCydv3.png"><br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XpuDCEW.png"><br/>System assigned:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/knAxkRg.png"><br/>Test - New VM:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dG1RcMZ.png"><br/>New VM - IAM - automatic role assignments - vm admin login:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/F3HNSo7.png"></ins></details>|
|2|Azure Locks|* As an admin, you may need to lock a subscription, resource group, or resource to prevent other users in your organization from accidentally deleting or modifying critical resources. You can set the lock level to **CanNotDelete** or **ReadeOnly**. In the3 portal, the locks are called **Delete** & **Read-only** respectively.<br/><br/>* **CanNotDelte** means authorized users can still read & modify a resource, but they can't delete ther resource.<br/><br/>* **ReadOnly** means authorized users can read a resource, but they can't delete or update the resource. Applying this lock is similar to restricting all authorized users to the permissions granted by the **Reader** role<br/><br/>**How locks are applied**<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7LJMTnI.png"><details><summary>e.g. - LockType Delete - scope RG</summary>Lock Type Delete:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/fnT8g2j.png"><br/>Test - delete RG - error lock:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NUhQWyR.png"><br/>idem with try to delete vnet:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/70mjBpC.png"></details><br/>**Considerations before applying locks**<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wS9RtKO.png"><br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/O24m2tn.png">|
|3|Azure Policy|* Azure Policy helps to enfore organizational standards & to assess compliance. Through its compliance dashboard, it provides a view to evaluate the overrall state of the environment.<br/><br/>* Azure Policy also helps to bring your resources to compliance though bulk remediation for existing resources & automatic remediation for new resources 
|4|App Registration|* Any app that outsources authentication to AAD must be registered in a directory (tenant)<br/><br/>* Registration involves telling AAD about the app, including the URL where it's located, the URL to send replies to after auth, the URI to identify your app, and more<br/><br/><ins>e.g - SAML web UI login Fortigate:</ins>|
