|1|You have an Azure subscription named Sub1 that contains an Azure Log Analytics workspace named LAW01<br/>You have 100 on-premises servers that run Windows Server 2012 R2 & Windows Server 2016. The servers connect to LAW1. LAW1 is configured to collect security-related performance couters from the connected servers<br/>You need to configure alerts based on the data collected by LAW1. The solution must meet the following requirements:<br/>- Alert rules must support dimensions<br/>-The time it take to generate an alert must be minimized<br/>- Alert notifications must be generated only once when the alert is generated & once when the alert is resolved<br/><br/>Which signal type should you use when you create the alert rule?<br/><br/>a. log<br/>b. Log (saved Query)<br/>c. Metric<br/>d. Activity log|<details><summary>Answer</summary>c. metric<br/><br/>Ther are many benefits for using metric alerts for logs over query based log alerts in azure. Some of them are listed below:<br/><br/>Metric Alerts offer near-real time monitoring capability & Metric Alerts for Logs forks data from log source to ensure the same<br/><br/>Metric Alerts are stateful - only notifying once when alert is fired & once when alert is resolved; as opposed to Log alerts which are stateless & keep firing at every intervall if the alert condition is met<br/><br/>Metric alerts for Log provide multiple dimesions, allowing filtering to specific values like Computers, OS Type, etc. simpler; without the need for penning query in analytics</details>|

|15|You have an Azure subscription named Sub1 that contains the virtual machines<br/>Shown in the following table<br/><table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Name&nbsp;</td> <td>Resource group&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>VM1&nbsp;</td> <td>RG1&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>VM2&nbsp;</td> <td>RG2&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>VM3&nbsp;</td> <td>RG1&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>VM4&nbsp;</td> <td>RG2&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody> </table><br/>You need to ensure that the virtual machines in RG1 have the Remote Desktop port closed until an authorized user requests access<br/>What should you confiugre?<br/><br/>a. AAD PIM<br/>b. an ASG<br/>c. AAD CA<br/>d. JIT VM access|<details><summary>Answer</summary>c. JIT VM access<br/><br/>JIT VM access can be used to lock down inbound traffic to your Azure VMs, reducing exposure to attacks while providing easy access to connect to VMs when needed<br/><br/>Note : When JIT is enabled, Security Center locks down inbound traffic to your Azure VMs by creating an NSG rule. You select the ports on the VM to which inbound traffic will be locked down. These ports are controlled by the JIT solution<br/>When a user requests access to a VM, Secuirty Center checks that the user has RBAC permissions that permit them to successfully request access to a VM<br/>If the request is approved, Secuirty Center automatically configures the NSGs & Azure Firewall to allow inbound traffic to the selected ports & requested source IP addresses or ranges, for the amount of time that was specified<br/>After the time has expired, Security Center restores the NSGs to their previous states. Those connections that already established are not being interrupted, however<br/>ref:<br/>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/just-in-time-access-usage</details>|
