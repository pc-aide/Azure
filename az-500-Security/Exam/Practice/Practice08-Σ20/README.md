|14|You use Azure Security Center for the centralized policy management of three Azure subscriptions<br/>You use several policy definitions to manage the security of the subscriptions<br/>You need to deploy the policy definitions as a group to all three subscriptions<br/>Solution : You create an initiave & an assignment that is scoped to a management group<br/><br/>Does this meet the goal?<br/><br/>a. yes<br/>b. no|<details><summary>Answer</summary>a. yes<br/><br/>An assignment is a policy definition or initiative that has been assigned to take place within a specific scope. This scope could range from a management group to an individual resource. The term scope refers to all the resources, resource group, subscription, or management groups that the definition is assigned to. Assignments are inherited by all child resources. This design means that a defintion applied to a resource group is also applied to resources in that resource group. However, you can exclude a subscope fro mthe assignement<br/>ref:<br/>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview#assignments</details>|
