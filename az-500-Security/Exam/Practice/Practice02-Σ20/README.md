Yes (Already active)<br/>2. Yes (the user will be prompted for MFA regardless the MFA Status of the user)<br/>3. No (Even the user is included in the group, a user can't approve itself)</details>|
|2|You have a hybrid configuration of AAD that has SSO enabled. You have an Azure SQL DAtabase instance that is configured to support AAD authentication<br/>Database developers must connect to the database instance from the domain joined device & authenticate by using their on-premises AD account<br/>You need to ensure that developers can connect to the instance by using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. The solution must minimize authentication prompts<br/><br/>Which authentication method should you recommend?<br/><br/>a. AD - Password<br/>b. AD - Universal with MFA support<br/>c. SQL Server Authentication<br/>d. AD - Integrated|<details><summary>Answer</summary>d. AD - Integrated<br/><br/>AAD - Password --> Use this method for connecting to SQL Database if you are logged in  to Windows using credentials from a doamin that is not federated with Azure<br/><br/>AD - Integrated --> Use this method for connecting to SQL Database if you are logged in to Windows using your AAD credentials from a federated domain<br/><br/>Our keyword is "SSO" so option D is the answer</details>|
|3|You plan to use ARM templates to perform multiple deployments of identically confiugred Azure VMs. The password for the administrator account of each deployment is sotred as a secret in different Azure key vaults<br/><br/>You need to identify a method to dynamically construct a resource ID that will designate the key vault containing the appropriate secret during each deployment<br/><br/>The name of the key vault & the name of the secret will be provided as inline parameters<br/><br/>What should you use to construct the resource ID?<br/><br/>a. key vault access policy<br/>b. a linked template<br/>c. a parameter file<br/.d. an automation account|<details><summary>Answer</summary>b. a linked template<br/><br/>As stated, you need to identify a method to dynamically<br/>The answer must be b. Because, you can't dynamically generate the resource ID in the parameters file because template expressions aren't allowd in the parameters file<br/><br/>ref:<br/>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/key-vault-parameter?tabs=azure-cli#reference-secrets-with-dynamic-id</details>|
|4|You create a new Azue subscription that is assocaited to a new AAD tenant<br/>You create one active conditional access policy named Portal Policy.

|5|You have an AAD tenant that contains the users shown in the following table<br/><table> <tbody> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Name</td> <td>Member of&nbsp;</td> <td>MFA status&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;User1</td> <td>Group1, Group2&nbsp;</td> <td>Disabled&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;User2</td> <td>&nbsp;Group2</td> <td>Disabled&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody> </table><br/>The tenant contains the named locations shown in the following table<br/><table> <tbody> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Name</td> <td>IP address range&nbsp;</td> <td>Trusted location&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Seattle</td> <td>193.77.10.0/24&nbsp;</td> <td>Yes&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Boston&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;154.12.18.0/24</td> <td>No&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody> </table><br/>You create the conditional access policies for a cloud app named App1 as shown in the following table<br/><table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Name&nbsp;</td> <td>Include&nbsp;</td> <td>Exclude&nbsp;</td> <td>Condition&nbsp;</td> <td>Grant&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Policy1</td> <td>Group1&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;Group2</td> <td>Locations : Boston&nbsp;</td> <td>Block access&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Policy2&nbsp;</td> <td>Group1&nbsp;</td> <td>None&nbsp;</td> <td>Locations : Any location&nbsp;</td> <td>Grant access, Require MFA&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Policy3&nbsp;</td> <td>Group2&nbsp;</td> <td>Group1&nbsp;</td> <td>Locations : Boston&nbsp;</td> <td>Block access&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Policy4&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;User2</td> <td>None&nbsp;</td> <td>Locations : Any location</td> <td>Grant access, Require MFA&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody> </table><br/>For each of the following statements, select Yes if the staement is true. Otherwise, select No<br/>NOTE : Each correct selection is worth one point<br/><table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Statements&nbsp;</td> <td>Yes&nbsp;</td> <td>No&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>&nbsp;User1 can access App1 from an IP&nbsp;</p> <p>address of 154.12.18.10</p> </td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>User2 can access App1 from an IP</p> <p>address of 193.77.10.15&nbsp;</p> </td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>User2 can access App1 from an IP</p> <p>address of 154.12.18.34&nbsp;</p> </td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>|<details><summary>Answer</summary>Yes - user is exluded from Policy1 as exlusion takes precedence. That means she hits Policy2 which grants access with MFA<br/><br/>Yes - User2 is exluded from Policy1. Policy2 is a complete miss. Policy3 matches the include but misses the location. We drop down to a final match on Policy4 which is specific to User2 which does grant access with MFA<br/><br/>No - User2 is exluded from Policy1. Policy2 is a complete miss. Policy3 we match the include and location which results in blockin access</details>|
|6|You have an Azure subscription named Sub1 that is associated to an AAD tenant named contoso.com.

Users who can "onboard" to AAD Identity Protection are typically those with permissions to configure and manage security features, such as identity risk detection.<br/><br/>Remediate: This involves taking actions to mitigate risks detected by AAD Identity Protection. This may include resetting passwords, blocking accounts, or other measures to secure the accounts of users exhibiting suspicious behaviors or activities.</details>|
