|2|You have a hybrid configuration of AAD that has SSO enabled. You have an Azure SQL DAtabase instance that is configured to support AAD authentication<br/>Database developers must connect to the database instance from the domain joined device & authenticate by using their on-premises AD account<br/>You need to ensure that developers can connect to the instance by using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. The solution must minimize authentication prompts<br/><br/>Which authentication method should you recommend?<br/><br/>a. AD - Password<br/>b. AD - Universal with MFA support<br/>c. SQL Server Authentication<br/>d. AD - Integrated|<details><summary>Answer</summary>d. AD - Integrated<br/><br/>AAD - Password --> Use this method for connecting to SQL Database if you are logged in  to Windows using credentials from a doamin that is not federated with Azure<br/><br/>AD - Integrated --> Use this method for connecting to SQL Database if you are logged in to Windows using your AAD credentials from a federated domain<br/><br/>Our keyword is "SSO" so option D is the answer</details>|
|3|You plan to use ARM templates to perform multiple deployments of identically confiugred Azure VMs. The password for the administrator account of each deployment is sotred as a secret in different Azure key vaults<br/><br/>You need to identify a method to dynamically construct a resource ID that will designate the key vault containing the appropriate secret during each deployment<br/><br/>The name of the key vault & the name of the secret will be provided as inline parameters<br/><br/>What should you use to construct the resource ID?<br/><br/>a. key vault access policy<br/>b. a linked template<br/>c. a parameter file<br/.d. an automation account|<details><summary>Answer</summary>b. a linked template<br/><br/>As stated, you need to identify a method to dynamically<br/>The answer must be b. Because, you can't dynamically generate the resource ID in the parameters file because template expressions aren't allowd in the parameters file<br/><br/>ref:<br/>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/key-vault-parameter?tabs=azure-cli#reference-secrets-with-dynamic-id</details>|
|4|You create a new Azue subscription that is assocaited to a new AAD tenant<br/>You create one active conditional access policy named Portal Policy. Portal Policy is used to provide access to the Microsoft Azure Management cloud app<br/>The Conditions settings for Portal Policy are configured as shown in the Conditions exhibit<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lWg6Jrg.png"><br/>The Grant settings for Portal Policy are configured as shown in the Grant exhibit<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xatZhBH.png"><br/>For each of the following statements, select yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No<br/>Note : Each correct selection is worth one point<br/><table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Statements&nbsp;</td> <td>Yes&nbsp;</td> <td>No&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>&nbsp;Users from the Contoso named location must</p> <p>use MFA to access the Azure portal</p> </td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Users from the Contoso named location must use</p> <p>MFA to access the web service hosted in the Azure</p> <p>subscription&nbsp;</p> </td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Users external to the Contoso named location must use MFA</p> <p>to access the Azure portal&nbsp;</p> </td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>|<details><summary>Answer</summary>Box 1 : is clearly No (Contoso is included from policy that forces MFA when accessing Azure portal)<br/>Box 2 : would say No, because accessing Azure Web Services is not part of this policy<br/>Box 3 : is clearly Yes (Users external to Contoso are not exluded from the policy that forces MFA when accessing the Azure portal)</details>|
|5|You have an AAD tenant that contains the users shown in the following table<br/><table> <tbody> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Name</td> <td>Member of&nbsp;</td> <td>MFA status&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;User1</td> <td>Group1, Group2&nbsp;</td> <td>Disabled&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;User2</td> <td>&nbsp;Group2</td> <td>Disabled&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody> </table><br/>The tenant contains the named locations shown in the following table<br/><table> <tbody> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Name</td> <td>IP address range&nbsp;</td> <td>Trusted location&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Seattle</td> <td>193.77.10.0/24&nbsp;</td> <td>Yes&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Boston&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;154.12.18.0/24</td> <td>No&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody> </table><br/>You create the conditional access policies for a cloud app named App1 as shown in the following table<br/><table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Name&nbsp;</td> <td>Include&nbsp;</td> <td>Exclude&nbsp;</td> <td>Condition&nbsp;</td> <td>Grant&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Policy1</td> <td>Group1&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;Group2</td> <td>Locations : Boston&nbsp;</td> <td>Block access&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Policy2&nbsp;</td> <td>Group1&nbsp;</td> <td>None&nbsp;</td> <td>Locations : Any location&nbsp;</td> <td>Grant access, Require MFA&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Policy3&nbsp;</td> <td>Group2&nbsp;</td> <td>Group1&nbsp;</td> <td>Locations : Boston&nbsp;</td> <td>Block access&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Policy4&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;User2</td> <td>None&nbsp;</td> <td>Locations : Any location</td> <td>Grant access, Require MFA&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody> </table><br/>For each of the following statements, select Yes if the staement is true. Otherwise, select No<br/>NOTE : Each correct selection is worth one point<br/><table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Statements&nbsp;</td> <td>Yes&nbsp;</td> <td>No&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>&nbsp;User1 can access App1 from an IP&nbsp;</p> <p>address of 154.12.18.10</p> </td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>User2 can access App1 from an IP</p> <p>address of 193.77.10.15&nbsp;</p> </td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>User2 can access App1 from an IP</p> <p>address of 154.12.18.34&nbsp;</p> </td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>|<details><summary>Answer</summary>Yes - user is exluded from Policy1 as exlusion takes precedence. That means she hits Policy2 which grants access with MFA<br/><br/>Yes - User2 is exluded from Policy1. Policy2 is a complete miss. Policy3 matches the include but misses the location. We drop down to a final match on Policy4 which is specific to User2 which does grant access with MFA<br/><br/>No - User2 is exluded from Policy1. Policy2 is a complete miss. Policy3 we match the include and location which results in blockin access</details>|
