|17|You have Azure web app named webApp1<br/>You need to configure continious deployment for webApp1 by using an Azure Repo<br/>What should you create first?<br/><br/>a. an Azure Application Insights service<br/>b. an Azure DevOps organization<br/>c. an Azure Storage account<br/>d. an Azure DevTest Labs lab|<details><summary>Answer</summary>b. an Azure DevOps organization<br/><br/>To use Repos, make sure your Azure DevOps organizations is linked to your Azure subscription<br/>ref:<br/>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-continuous-deployment?tabs=github</details>|
|18|Your company has Azure subscription named Sub1 that is associated to an AAD tenant named contoso.com<br/>The company develops an application named App1. App1 is registered in AAD<br/>You need to ensure that App1 can access secrets in Azure Key vAult on behalf of the application users<br/><br/>What should you configure?<br/>a. an application permission without admin consent<br/>b. a delegated permission without admin consent<br/>c. a delegated permission that requries admin consent<br/>d. an application permission that requries admin consent|<details><summary>Answer</summary>b. a delegated permission without admin consent<br/><br/>some higher privileged permissions require administrator consent - here we need just access to key vault<br/><br/>**Delegated Permissions:** These are used by apps that have a signed-in user present. For these apps, the app accesses an API as the signed-in user. Delegated permissions are appropriate for applications that access a web API as the signed-in user. <br/><br/>**Application Permissions:** These are used by apps that run without a signed-in user present; for example, apps that run as background services or daemons. Application permissions grant full access to all the data in a service in every tenant. It's not suitable in this scenario because you need the app to access Azure Key Vault on behalf of the user, not as a background service.<br/><br/>**Admin Consent Requirement:** Delegated permissions might require an administrator's consent, especially for high-privileged operations or when accessing sensitive data. Since accessing secrets in Azure Key Vault can be considered sensitive, admin consent is typically required. Therefore, option (c) "a delegated permission that requires admin consent" is the appropriate configuration for your scenario. This allows App1 to act on behalf of a user with the necessary permissions to access secrets in Azure Key Vault, while also ensuring that an administrator has approved this level of access.</details>|
