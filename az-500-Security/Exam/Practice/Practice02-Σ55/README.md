The resource owner directly assigns the user to the resource<br/><br/>Group assignment. The resource owner assigns an Azure AD group to the resource, which automatically gives all of the group members access to the resource. Group membership is managed by both the group owner and the resource owner, letting either owner add or remove members from the group. For more information about adding or removing group membership, see How to: Add or remove a group from another group using the Azure Active Directory portal<br/><br/>Rule-based assignment. The resource owner creates a group and uses a rule to define which users are assigned to a specific resource. The rule is based on attributes that are assigned to individual users. The resource owner manages the rule, determining which attributes and values are required to allow access the resource. For more information, see Create a dynamic group and check status<br/><br/>External authority assignment. Access comes from an external source, such as an on-premises directory or a SaaS app. In this situation, the resource owner assigns a group to provide access to the resource and then the external source manages the group members.<br/><br/>Reference(s): https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-manage-groups?context=/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/context/ugr-context</details>|
