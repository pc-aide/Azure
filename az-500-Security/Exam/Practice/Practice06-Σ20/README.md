|6|You are configuring & securing a network environment<br/>You deploy an Azure virtual machine named VM1 that configured to analyze network traffic<br/>You need to ensure that all network traffic is routed through VM1<br/>What should you configre?<br/><br/>a. a system route<br/>b. a NSG<br/>c. UDR|<details><summary>Answer</summary>c. UDR<br/><br/>Although the use of system routes facilitates traffic automatically for your deployment, there are cases in which you want to control the routing of packets through a virtual applicance. You can do so by creating user defined routes that specify the net hop for packets flowing to a specific subnet to go to your virtual ppliance instead, & enabling IP forwarding for the VM running as the virtual appliance<br/><br/>UDRs -<br/>For most environment you will only need the system routes already defined by Azure. However, you may need to create a route table & add one or more routes in specific cases, such as :<br/>- Force tunneling to the Internet via your on-premises network<br/>- Use of virtual appliances in your Azure environment<br/>- In the scenarios above, you'll have to create a route table & add user defined routes to it<br/>ref:<br/>https://github.com/uglide/azure-content/blob/master/articles/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview.md</details>|
