|1|Application Security Group|**ASG** in Azure is a construct used to configure network security for Azure resources. Essentially, it's a way to group virtual machines (VMs), virtual machine scale sets, and network interfaces into a single logical entity for the purpose of applying network security rules. By associating ASGs with security rules in network security groups (NSGs), you can define and enforce network traffic policies based on these logical groupings rather than individual resources. This helps simplify network security management, especially in complex environments with multiple resources and diverse communication patterns. ASGs enable you to define rules that apply uniformly to all resources within the group, enhancing security and simplifying management in Azure deployments.|<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9hhI06h.png">|

|3|Cross-vnet connectivity options|Cross-vnet connectivity options in Azure refer to the various methods available for establishing network connectivity between virtual networks (VNets) located in different Azure regions or subscriptions. These options enable seamless communication and data exchange between resources deployed in separate VNets, facilitating scenarios such as multi-region deployments, hybrid cloud architectures, and global network connectivity. Some common cross-vnet connectivity options in Azure include Virtual Network Peering, VPN Gateway, Azure ExpressRoute, and Azure Private Link. Each option has its own features, benefits, and use cases, allowing Azure users to choose the most suitable connectivity solution based on their specific requirements.|<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nda3hWL.png">|

|5|ExpressRoute|ExpressRoute in Azure is a service that enables you to create private connections between Azure datacenters and infrastructure on your premises or in a colocation environment. With ExpressRoute, you can establish a dedicated, private connection from your network to Azure, which can offer higher security, reliability, and speeds compared to connections over the internet. This dedicated connection does not go over the public internet, which can improve performance and security for hybrid cloud scenarios|<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YogEKaF.png"><br/>ExpressRoute - FastPath unsupported:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5cGBECk.png"><br/>ER - Global Reach (is an add-on service that allows us to link ER circuits):<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Z6OUOWZ.png"><br/>by default no secure (or encrypted) connectivity, so we can Microsoft offers 2 optional solutions for encrypting data in transit<br/>1. point-to-point encrytpion with MACsec<br/>2. end-to-end encryption with IPsec<br/>MACsec is not end-to-end encryption:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IfFQFUA.png">|
|6|Hub & spoke architecture|a network topology where there is a central "hub" that connects to multiple "spokes." In this architecture, the hub typically represents a central network or a virtual network gateway, while the spokes are individual networks that are connected to the hub<br/><br/>Each spoke can communicate with the other spokes via the hub, allowing for centralized management and control of network traffic. This architecture is commonly used in scenarios where there is a need for secure communication between multiple networks, such as in a hub-and-spoke virtual network topology in Azure's networking services.|<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RrZjLgh.png">|
