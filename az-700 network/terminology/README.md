|1|Application Security Group|**ASG** in Azure is a construct used to configure network security for Azure resources. Essentially, it's a way to group virtual machines (VMs), virtual machine scale sets, and network interfaces into a single logical entity for the purpose of applying network security rules. By associating ASGs with security rules in network security groups (NSGs), you can define and enforce network traffic policies based on these logical groupings rather than individual resources. This helps simplify network security management, especially in complex environments with multiple resources and diverse communication patterns. ASGs enable you to define rules that apply uniformly to all resources within the group, enhancing security and simplifying management in Azure deployments.|<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9hhI06h.png">|

|3|Integration subnet|In Azure, an integration subnet, also known as a dedicated subnet, is a special subnet within a vVNet that is reserved for connecting Azure services, such as **Azure App Service**, Azure Functions, or Azure SQL Database, to the VNet securely. This subnet is used to establish private and secure connections between the Azure service and the resources within the VNet, ensuring that traffic between them remains within the Azure network infrastructure and does not traverse the internet. Integration subnets are typically used for scenarios where secure communication between **Azure services** & **resources in a VNet** is required, such as accessing on-premises resources securely through a VPN or connecting to Azure services privately without exposing them to the public internet.|<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SRAhHMZ.png"><br/><ins>WebApp\networking\oubound traffinc\vnet integration:</ins><br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uYKEF43.png"><br/>Add vnet integration :<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Va9zKmi.png"><br/>Add Inbound security rule - NSG<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/07bkH0O.png"><br/>Test the connection from WebApp - Advanced tools to the VM:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5Im19GB.png"><br/>result:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eqEOyaA.png">|

|5|Private enpoint|a private endpoint is a network interface that connects privately to a service powered by Azure. It provides a secure and direct connection between your virtual network and the service, ensuring that network traffic between the two stays within the Microsoft Azure backbone network. This helps enhance security by keeping traffic off the public internet and within the confines of your virtual network, thereby reducing exposure to potential threats|<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nuItCIo.png"><br/>Storage Account with Private Endpoint :<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Z6nM84n.png"><br/>DNS Configuration :<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LK8A5Rp.png"><br/>Our VM need update DNS, bad return Alias of the storage account :<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bWbSxs6.png"><br/>if we use arg Public IP from our VM, the answer will correct:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ctc7hjV.png"><br/>dnsMgmt.msc - conditional forwarders:<br/>|
|6|Service Tag|a service tag is a convenient way to group specific IP address ranges associated with Azure services. This simplifies network security by allowing you to define rules based on service tags rather than individual IP addresses|<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ulkJfEj.png"><br/>NSG ServiceTag Outboud to Block StorageAccount:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pg4Mtka.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6cEYaYd.png">|
