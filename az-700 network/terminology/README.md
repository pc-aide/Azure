|1|Application Security Group|**ASG** in Azure is a construct used to configure network security for Azure resources. Essentially, it's a way to group virtual machines (VMs), virtual machine scale sets, and network interfaces into a single logical entity for the purpose of applying network security rules. By associating ASGs with security rules in network security groups (NSGs), you can define and enforce network traffic policies based on these logical groupings rather than individual resources. This helps simplify network security management, especially in complex environments with multiple resources and diverse communication patterns. ASGs enable you to define rules that apply uniformly to all resources within the group, enhancing security and simplifying management in Azure deployments.|<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9hhI06h.png">|

|3|Integration subnet|In Azure, an integration subnet, also known as a dedicated subnet, is a special subnet within a vVNet that is reserved for connecting Azure services, such as **Azure App Service**, Azure Functions, or Azure SQL Database, to the VNet securely. This subnet is used to establish private and secure connections between the Azure service and the resources within the VNet, ensuring that traffic between them remains within the Azure network infrastructure and does not traverse the internet. Integration subnets are typically used for scenarios where secure communication between **Azure services** & **resources in a VNet** is required, such as accessing on-premises resources securely through a VPN or connecting to Azure services privately without exposing them to the public internet.|<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SRAhHMZ.png"><br/><ins>WebApp\networking\oubound traffinc\vnet integration:</ins><br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uYKEF43.png"><br/>Add vnet integration :<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Va9zKmi.png"><br/>Add Inbound security rule - NSG<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/07bkH0O.png"><br/>Test the connection from WebApp - Advanced tools to the VM:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5Im19GB.png"><br/>result:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eqEOyaA.png">|

|5|Private enpoint|a private endpoint is a network interface that connects privately to a service powered by Azure. It provides a secure and direct connection between your virtual network and the service, ensuring that network traffic between the two stays within the Microsoft Azure backbone network. This helps enhance security by keeping traffic off the public internet and within the confines of your virtual network, thereby reducing exposure to potential threats|<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nuItCIo.png"><br/>Storage Account with Private Endpoint :<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Z6nM84n.png"><br/>DNS Configuration :<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LK8A5Rp.png"><br/>Our VM need update DNS, bad return Alias of the storage account :<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bWbSxs6.png"><br/>if we use arg Public IP from our VM, the answer will correct:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ctc7hjV.png"><br/>dnsMgmt.msc -  New Conditional Forwarder:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yjf5iCK.png"><br/>Test again our nslookup with flush DNS-cache first:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/TxBJ53u.png"><br/><br/>**Note** if we tester another vnet from our VM - it will be not working (not respond):<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nfzD2sL.png"><br/>Why is fail if the DNS is correct ?<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Pv9NQ8i.png"><br/>Conditional Forwarder in each subnet with default DNS - 168.3.129.16:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CLwx0z4.png"><br/>Forward lookup zone:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/D4Rsk4C.png"><br/>dnsMgmt.msc - remove our conditional forwarder - we need something better here:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MJtma7c.png"><br/>Forward lookup zone - new zone:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ELF5hjh.png"><br/>Primary zone:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/EO3Oogt.png"><br/>replicate to all DNS in the domain:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SlKmSp6.png"><br/>zone name:<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0Qcy8hX.png"><br/>default with dynamic update :<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7hb01Vn.png"><br/>New host<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/29JoS3T.png"><br/>samething for another storageAccount:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MOKnn8V.png"><br/>test again our two storage account:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bqOIPTP.png"><br/>Test on another subnet for the two storageAccount:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9eTK50U.png">|
|6|Service Endpoint Policies|service endpoint policies are sets of configurations that dictate the network access controls for specific Azure service endpoints. These policies define rules and restrictions governing traffic flow between virtual networks and Azure services, enabling fine-grained control over network communication and security measures.|<img src="https://i.imgur.com/mnYVrlj.png"><br/>New service endpoint policies:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gdWTW2f.png"><br/>associated sunbnet:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tAcgLZz.png">|
|7|Service Tag|a service tag is a convenient way to group specific IP address ranges associated with Azure services. This simplifies network security by allowing you to define rules based on service tags rather than individual IP addresses|<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ulkJfEj.png"><br/>NSG ServiceTag Outboud to Block StorageAccount:<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pg4Mtka.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6cEYaYd.png">|

|8|Virtual WAN|Azure Virtual WAN is a networking service provided by Microsoft Azure that simplifies the deployment and management of wide-area network (WAN) connections. It enables seamless connectivity between various branches, data centers, and Azure resources, facilitating efficient communication and data transfer across the network. With Virtual WAN, organizations can establish secure and optimized connections, centrally manage their network infrastructure, and ensure reliable performance for their distributed applications and workloads. The service offers features such as automated VPN connections, built-in security measures, traffic optimization, and simplified configuration through a centralized portal, enhancing the scalability, flexibility, and efficiency of wide-area network deployments in the cloud.|
